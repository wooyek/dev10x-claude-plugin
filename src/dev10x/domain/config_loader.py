"""ConfigLoader Protocol — shared interface for YAML config loading.

Defines the loading interface that config/loader.py implements
with msgpack caching. Standalone uv scripts in skills/permission/
may inline their own loading — this is an acceptable trade-off
since they run outside the dev10x package context.
