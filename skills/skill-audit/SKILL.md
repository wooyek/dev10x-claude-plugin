# Skill Audit

Analyze a Claude Code session transcript for skill compliance, missed invocations,
user corrections, and process improvements worth persisting into skill definitions.

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.

**Auto-advance:** Complete each phase, immediately start the next.
Never pause between phases.

### Step 0: Initialize task tracking (MANDATORY)

**REQUIRED: Create all tasks before ANY other work.**
Do NOT skip task creation or improvise an ad-hoc workflow.
If you find yourself reading files or analyzing the transcript
without having created tasks first, STOP and create them now.

Execute these exact `TaskCreate` calls at startup:

**Setup (sequential):**

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Resolve session file", description="Find and validate the session JSONL file from the provided path or most recent session", activeForm="Resolving session")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Extract and read transcript", description="Run extract-session.sh to parse the JSONL file into a readable transcript", activeForm="Extracting transcript")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Detect project context", description="Identify project directory, loaded skills, and CLAUDE.md rules from the transcript", activeForm="Detecting context")`

**Wave 1 — parallel analysis (independent phases):**

4. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 1: Action inventory [subagent]", description="Dispatch subagent to catalogue all tool calls, skill invocations, and agent dispatches", activeForm="Inventorying actions")`
5. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 4: Permission friction [subagent]", description="Dispatch subagent to identify permission prompts, hook blocks, and allow-rule gaps", activeForm="Analyzing permissions")`

**Wave 2 — parallel analysis (depends on Phase 1 output):**

6. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 2: Skill coverage [subagent]", description="Dispatch subagent to check which skills should have been invoked but were missed", activeForm="Analyzing coverage")`
7. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 3: Compliance check [subagent]", description="Dispatch subagent to verify skill execution matched documented orchestration steps", activeForm="Checking compliance")`
8. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 5: Lessons learned [subagent]", description="Dispatch subagent to extract corrections, confirmations, and process improvements", activeForm="Extracting lessons")`

**Synthesis (sequential, main agent):**

9. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 6: Propose changes", description="Synthesize findings into concrete SKILL.md edits, memory updates, and process improvements", activeForm="Proposing changes")`
10. `TaskCreate(subject="Phase 7: Upstream reporting", description="File findings as GitHub issues at the Dev10x plugin repo via Dev10x:audit-report", activeForm="Reporting upstream")`

Set dependencies:
- Tasks 1→2→3 sequential (setup chain)
- Tasks 4 and 5 both blocked by task 3 (Wave 1 — run in parallel)
- Tasks 6, 7, 8 all blocked by task 4 (Wave 2 — run in parallel after Phase 1)
- Task 9 blocked by tasks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (all analysis complete)
- Task 10 blocked by task 9

Update each task to `in_progress` before starting it and
`completed` when done.

### Batched decision queue (Phase 6)

As earlier phases discover findings that need user decisions
(skill updates, memory changes, allow rules), queue them in
task metadata rather than interrupting. Use `TaskUpdate` with
`metadata.decisions_queued` to record each finding, then collect
all queued decisions into a single `AskUserQuestion` batch in
Phase 6 so the user approves or rejects all changes at once.

## Arguments

The skill accepts one optional argument, resolved in this order:

1. **JSONL path** — if arg ends in `.jsonl`, use it directly
2. **Worktree path** — if arg is a directory (e.g., `/work/myproject/my-repo`), encode it
   to a project directory and find the latest JSONL in it
3. **`latest`** (or no arg) — encode the current working directory, find latest JSONL

**Path encoding**: `/work/myproject/my-repo` → `-work-myproject-my-repo` (replace leading `/` then
all `/` with `-`).

**Project directory**: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/`

## Proactive Triggers

**Auto-suggest this skill (DO NOT run it inline) when you detect:**

1. **Raw scripts instead of tools** — You wrote 3+ raw `gh api`, shell pipelines,
   or other manual commands when a dedicated tool exists. The audit captures which
   tools were missed so memory/skills can be updated.

2. **Repeated user corrections** — The user corrected your approach 3+ times
   in the same session (wrong triage verdict, wrong tone, wrong implementation
   choice). The audit extracts patterns from corrections and proposes skill updates.

3. **Skill deviation pattern** — You skipped documented steps in a skill 2+ times
   (e.g., forgot to resolve threads after replying, forgot one-fixup-per-comment rule).

4. **Permission friction** — The user had to approve 3+ safe, repetitive commands
   (e.g., `pytest`, `uv run`, `psql ... SELECT`) that should be pre-approved.
   The audit compares each prompted command against `settings.local.json` allow
   rules and proposes new patterns to eliminate the friction.

5. **Inline shell scripts** — A skill (SKILL.md) contains 3+ Bash lines written
   inline, OR a session used a multi-step shell pipeline/heredoc that would need
   repeated approval. Inline scripts can't be pre-approved with a single allow
   rule; extracting them to a `scripts/` file under a skill lets the user grant
   one `Bash(~/.claude/skills/<skill>/scripts/:*)` rule instead.

6. **Structural command friction** — You used `$()` subshells, `&&` chains,
   `git -C`, env var prefixes, or leading `#` comments that broke allow-rule
   prefix matching, AND the user had to reject/correct the approach. These
   are fundamentally unfixable with allow rules — they need skill updates
   and/or hookify rules to prevent recurrence. The audit's Step 4c detects
   these patterns and proposes both skill fixes and auto-reject hooks.

7. **Hook-blocked retries** — A PreToolUse hook rejected a command (e.g.,
   `cat <<` blocked by `validate-bash-security.py`) but you attempted the
   same pattern again in the same session. The audit detects these as
   HOOK_BLOCKED_RETRY and proposes skill updates to use the correct
   alternative.

8. **Redundant `uv run --script` prefixes** — A skill or shell script
   invokes a Python script with `uv run --script path/to/script.py` when
   the script already has `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` shebang and
   is executable. The prefix is redundant, breaks allow-rule matching
   (prefix becomes `uv` instead of the script path), and makes the command
   harder to pre-approve. The audit's Step 4g detects these and proposes
   dropping the prefix.

When a trigger is detected, find the current session's JSONL path and suggest:

> "I've noticed [trigger description]. Open a new terminal and run:
> ```
> claude '/Dev10x:skill-audit <jsonl-path>'
> ```
> to capture these as improvements."

To find the current session's JSONL path, use:
```bash
ls -t ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl | head -1
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve session file

```python
import os, glob

arg = "$SKILL_ARG"  # from the invocation
claude_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.claude")

if arg.endswith(".jsonl"):
    session_file = arg
elif arg and os.path.isdir(arg):
    encoded = arg.replace("/", "-")
    if encoded.startswith("-"):
        pass  # already correct
    project_dir = f"{claude_dir}/projects/{encoded}"
    jsonls = sorted(glob.glob(f"{project_dir}/*.jsonl"), key=os.path.getmtime, reverse=True)
    session_file = jsonls[0]  # latest
else:
    cwd = os.getcwd()
    encoded = cwd.replace("/", "-")
    project_dir = f"{claude_dir}/projects/{encoded}"
    jsonls = sorted(glob.glob(f"{project_dir}/*.jsonl"), key=os.path.getmtime, reverse=True)
    session_file = jsonls[0]  # latest
```

Implement this logic using Bash (ls -t + head) rather than running Python inline.
If resolution fails, ask the user to provide the JSONL path explicitly.

### Step 1.5: Self-session guard

After resolving the JSONL path, check if the resolved file is the
**current session** by testing whether the file was modified within
the last 60 seconds (active sessions write continuously):

```bash
find "$SESSION_FILE" -mmin -1 -print
```

If the file matches (output is non-empty), this is likely the
current session. **STOP** and emit a redirect message:

> This audit targets the current session. Running it here will
> consume the context window before useful analysis begins.
> Open a **new terminal** and run:
> ```
> claude '/Dev10x:skill-audit <session-file-path>'
> ```

Do NOT proceed with extraction. Do NOT ask the user if they
want to continue anyway — self-auditing always produces poor
results because the audit itself dominates the transcript.

### Step 2: Extract transcript

Create a unique output file:
```bash
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit audit-transcript .md
```
Store the returned path, then run the extraction script:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-audit/scripts/extract-session.sh \
  "<session_file>" <unique-path>
```

> **Note:** Do NOT prefix this with `mkdir -p ... &&` — the `mktmp.sh` script
> creates the directory automatically. Prefixing with `mkdir &&` shifts
> the command prefix to `mkdir`, breaking the `Bash(~/.claude/skills:*)` allow rule.

### Step 3: Read the transcript

Use the Read tool to read the transcript at the unique path returned in Step 2.
This is the session you are auditing.

### Step 4: Detect project context

From the transcript header, extract the **Project** path. Encode it to determine
the correct memory directory:
```
~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-path>/memory/
```

Also locate the skills directory: `~/.claude/skills/`

### Step 5: Create output files

Create a temp file for each analysis phase's output:

```bash
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit phase1-actions .md
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit phase2-coverage .md
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit phase3-compliance .md
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit phase4-permissions .md
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit phase5-lessons .md
```

Store the returned paths — subagents write their findings here
and the main agent reads them in Phase 6.

**Subagent output strategy:** Subagents dispatched via `Agent()`
cannot reliably write to output files — `bypassPermissions` does
not propagate to subagents, and `settings.local.json` allow rules
may not take effect depending on the permission mode. The primary
strategy is to have each subagent **return its findings as the
Agent result string**, then have the main agent write output files
from the returned values.

**Fallback:** If direct file writes are needed, the user must
have these rules in their `settings.local.json`:
```json
["Write", {"glob": "/tmp/claude/skill-audit/**"}],
["Read", {"glob": "/tmp/claude/skill-audit/**"}],
["Edit", {"glob": "/tmp/claude/skill-audit/**"}]
```

Even with these rules, writes may still fail. Always design
subagent prompts to return complete findings as their result.

### Step 6: Wave 1 — dispatch parallel subagents

**REQUIRED: Launch both subagents in a single message** so they
run concurrently. Each subagent reads the transcript independently,
follows its phase instructions from the Phase Reference section
below, and writes findings to its output file. DO NOT use code
blocks for these calls — they are mandatory instructions.

Include the full text of each phase's instructions from the Phase
Reference section in the subagent prompt. Replace `<PLACEHOLDERS>`
with actual paths from previous steps.

**REQUIRED: Include this output note in every subagent prompt:**
"Return your complete findings as your response. Also attempt to
write them to the output file path provided using the Write tool,
but if the write fails, the main agent will capture your findings
from the returned result."

1. `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", description="Phase 1: Action inventory", prompt="You are running Phase 1 (Action Inventory) of a skill audit. Return your complete findings as your response. Also attempt to write them to <PHASE1_OUTPUT> using the Write tool — if the write fails, the main agent will capture your findings from the returned result. Read the session transcript at: <TRANSCRIPT_PATH>. Skills directory: <SKILLS_DIR>. [Include full Phase 1: Action Inventory instructions from the Phase Reference section].")`

2. `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", description="Phase 4: Permission friction", prompt="You are running Phase 4 (Permission Friction Analysis) of a skill audit. Return your complete findings as your response. Also attempt to write them to <PHASE4_OUTPUT> using the Write tool — if the write fails, the main agent will capture your findings from the returned result. Read the session transcript at: <TRANSCRIPT_PATH>. Project settings: ~/.claude/settings.local.json. Skills directory: <SKILLS_DIR>. [Include full Phase 4: Permission Friction Analysis instructions from the Phase Reference section, all sub-steps 4a through 4g].")`

Wait for both subagents to complete. Mark tasks 4 and 5 as
`completed` as each returns. If a subagent's output file was not
written, use the returned result to write it from the main agent.

### Step 7: Wave 2 — dispatch dependent subagents

After Wave 1, Phase 1's output file contains the action inventory
that Phases 2, 3, and 5 need.

**REQUIRED: Launch all three subagents in a single message** so
they run concurrently. Include the full text of each phase's
instructions from the Phase Reference section in each prompt.

1. `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", description="Phase 2: Skill coverage", prompt="You are running Phase 2 (Skill Coverage Analysis). Return your complete findings as your response. Also attempt to write them to <PHASE2_OUTPUT> — if the write fails, the main agent will capture your findings from the returned result. Phase 1 action inventory: <PHASE1_OUTPUT>. Skills directory: <SKILLS_DIR>. Read the Phase 1 output, then [include full Phase 2: Skill Coverage Analysis instructions from the Phase Reference section].")`

2. `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", description="Phase 3: Compliance check", prompt="You are running Phase 3 (Compliance Check). Return your complete findings as your response. Also attempt to write them to <PHASE3_OUTPUT> — if the write fails, the main agent will capture your findings from the returned result. Phase 1 action inventory: <PHASE1_OUTPUT>. Session transcript: <TRANSCRIPT_PATH>. Skills directory: <SKILLS_DIR>. Read the Phase 1 output, then [include full Phase 3: Compliance Check instructions from the Phase Reference section].")`

3. `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", description="Phase 5: Lessons learned", prompt="You are running Phase 5 (Lessons Learned Extraction). Return your complete findings as your response. Also attempt to write them to <PHASE5_OUTPUT> — if the write fails, the main agent will capture your findings from the returned result. Phase 1 action inventory: <PHASE1_OUTPUT>. Session transcript: <TRANSCRIPT_PATH>. Memory directory: <MEMORY_DIR>. Read the Phase 1 output, then [include full Phase 5: Lessons Learned Extraction instructions from the Phase Reference section].")`

Wait for all three subagents to complete. Mark tasks 6, 7, 8
as `completed` as each returns. If any output file was not written
by the subagent, use the returned result to write it from the
main agent.

### Step 8: Collect and synthesize

Read all five output files. If any file is empty or missing
(subagent write failed), the main agent should already have the
findings from the subagent's returned result — write them now.
The main agent now has the complete findings from all analysis
phases and proceeds to Phase 6
(Propose Changes) and Phase 7 (Upstream Reporting) directly —
these require user interaction and cannot be delegated.

---

## Phase Reference

The following phase descriptions are used both as inline reference
and as subagent prompt content. When dispatching a subagent, paste
the relevant phase section into the Agent prompt.

---

#### Phase 1: Action Inventory

Scan the transcript and catalog every significant action:

1. **Git operations**: commits, branch creation, rebases, pushes
2. **PR operations**: creation, review, comment responses, CI fixes
3. **Ticket operations**: creation, status changes, scoping
4. **Test operations**: running tests, fixing failures, coverage checks
5. **Code changes**: new files, refactoring, bug fixes
6. **Communication**: Slack messages, PR comments, Linear comments
7. **Process decisions**: user corrections, approach changes, manual overrides
8. **Configuration changes**: permissions, settings edits

For each action, note:
- What happened (brief description)
- Whether a skill was invoked (which one, or "none")
- Whether the user manually corrected the approach
- Look for `**[CORRECTION]**` markers in the transcript

Output a markdown table of actions.

---

#### Phase 2: Skill Coverage Analysis

For each action where NO skill was invoked:

1. Read SKILL.md files from `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
2. Check "When to Use" / trigger sections
3. Classify as:
   - **MISSED**: A skill exists and should have been used
   - **CORRECT_SKIP**: No applicable skill, or action was too simple
   - **GAP**: A skill SHOULD exist but doesn't

---

#### Phase 3: Compliance Check

For each action where a skill WAS invoked:

1. Read the corresponding SKILL.md
2. Compare actual steps against documented workflow
3. Identify deviations:
   - **SKIPPED_STEP**: A documented step was skipped
   - **WRONG_ORDER**: Steps executed out of order
   - **EXTRA_STEP**: An undocumented step was added
   - **DEVIATED**: A step was done differently
   - **COMPLIANT**: Skill was followed correctly
   - **PLAYBOOK_SUBSTITUTION**: A REQUIRED delegation was
     replaced by a playbook override's inline `prompt:`.
     This is COMPLIANT — playbook overrides are valid
     substitutions for REQUIRED markers. Do NOT classify
     as SKIPPED_STEP when the playbook provides an
     equivalent inline implementation.

Assess each deviation: improvement, regression, or neutral?

**AskUserQuestion enforcement check:** When a SKILL.md documents
`AskUserQuestion` (or marks a step as `REQUIRED: AskUserQuestion`),
verify the session transcript contains an actual `AskUserQuestion`
tool call at that decision point — not a plain text question. If
the transcript shows the agent asked the question as inline text
instead of calling the tool, classify it as:
- **DEVIATED** with assessment **regression** — plain text
  questions don't block execution and lack structured options

**Orchestration formatting check:** For each invoked skill, scan its
SKILL.md for mandatory tool calls (`TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`,
`AskUserQuestion`, `Agent`, `Skill`) that appear inside fenced code
blocks in the Orchestration or decision gate sections. Per
`skill-orchestration-format.md`, code blocks are treated as examples
and agents may skip them. If the session shows missing task tracking
or bypassed decision gates, check whether the SKILL.md formatting is
the root cause. Classify as:
- **DEVIATED** with assessment **regression** if the code-block
  formatting caused the agent to skip a mandatory step
- **GAP** if the formatting is wrong but the agent happened to
  execute correctly anyway (lucky compliance, not guaranteed)

---

#### Phase 4: Permission Friction Analysis

Identify tool calls that would have required user approval by comparing
them against the allow rules in `settings.local.json`. The JSONL format
does not explicitly tag permission prompts, so this phase uses pattern
matching: for every Bash, Read, Write, and Edit tool call in the
transcript, check whether it matches any existing allow rule.

**Step 4a: Inventory tool calls and match against allow rules**

Extract every Bash, Read, Write, and Edit tool call from the transcript.
For each, determine whether it matches any allow rule using the pattern
matching logic below.

**Allow rule format** (from `settings.local.json`):
```
"Bash(command-prefix:*)"   — matches if command starts with the prefix
"Read(/path/glob/**)"      — matches if file path matches the glob
"Write(/path/glob/**)"     — same for Write
"Edit(/path/glob/**)"      — same for Edit
```

**Matching algorithm**:
- `Bash(prefix:*)` matches if the command string starts with `prefix`
  (after stripping leading whitespace and env var assignments)
- `Read(/path/**)` matches if the file path starts with `/path/`
- Pipe chains: only the first command is matched against Bash rules

Record unmatched tool calls — these are the ones that would have
required a permission prompt.

Output a markdown table of all unmatched tool calls.

**Step 4b: Inline script detection**

Scan skills referenced during the session (`~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) for
inline shell content that should live in a `scripts/` file:

- Any `bash` or `sh` code block with 4+ lines, OR
- Any `python` code block used as a CLI one-liner (not as an example snippet), OR
- Any block that mixes curl/jq/awk/sed into a multi-step pipeline

For each candidate, note:

| Skill | Inline block (type + line count) | Suggested script path |
|-------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `Dev10x:some-skill` | 12-line bash loop | already extracted ✓ |
| `some:skill` | 8-line curl + jq pipeline | `scripts/fetch-data.sh` |

Also scan the session transcript for Bash tool calls that were multi-step
(heredoc, `&&`-chained, or 5+ commands in one call) — these are candidates
for extraction to a skill's `scripts/` directory even if no skill currently
owns them.

Classification:
- **EXTRACT_TO_SKILL_SCRIPT**: Inline script is complex enough to warrant a
  `scripts/` file; the parent skill should be updated + a `Bash(...scripts/:*)`
  allow rule added
- **EXTRACT_TO_NEW_SKILL**: The script logic is reusable but no skill owns it
  yet; suggest creating a skill with a `scripts/` directory
- **ACCEPTABLE_INLINE**: Short utility snippet (≤3 lines) — leave as-is

**Step 4c: Command Pattern Toxicity Analysis**

For each unmatched tool call from Step 4a, check whether the friction is
**structural** (no allow rule can ever fix it) vs **missing** (just needs
a new rule). Structural friction needs skill updates and/or hooks.

**Toxicity categories:**

| Category | Pattern | Why Allow Rules Fail | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PREFIX_POISONED_SUBSHELL` | `VAR=$(cmd) && script "$VAR"` | Prefix becomes `VAR=`, not `script` | Pass args directly to script |
| `PREFIX_POISONED_CHAIN` | `mkdir -p /tmp && script` | Prefix becomes `mkdir`, not `script` | Let script create dirs, or Write tool first |
| `PREFIX_POISONED_ENVVAR` | `ENV=val command` | Prefix becomes `ENV=`, not `command` | Script sets env internally |
| `PREFIX_POISONED_GIT_C` | `git -C /path log` | `git -C` doesn't match `Bash(git log:*)` | Use CWD, avoid `-C` |
| `PREFIX_POISONED_COMMENT` | `# comment\ncommand` | `#` breaks all prefix matching | Use Bash `description` param |
| `HOOK_BLOCKED_RETRY` | `cat <<'EOF'...` or `echo >` | Hook rejects it; Claude retries anyway | Update skill to use Write + `-F` |
| `NUISANCE_APPROVE` | Safe command prompted 3+ times | Allow rule exists but pattern doesn't match | Widen existing rule or add new one |
| `UNNECESSARY_CD_WORKTREE` | `cd /worktree/path && command` | `cd` shifts prefix; CWD is already the worktree | Drop the `cd` — session is already there |
| `WORKTREE_CWD_NOT_SWITCHED` | Commands run in main repo after worktree creation | Worktree creation should switch CWD | Investigate `Dev10x:git-worktree` — CWD switch may have failed |

**Detection algorithm:**

1. **Subshell poisoning**: Scan for `$(...) &&`, `$(...);`, or
   variable assignments like `VAR=$(...) && ...` where the second
   command is a pre-approved script path.

2. **Chain poisoning**: Scan for `cmd1 && cmd2` where `cmd2` matches
   a skill script path but `cmd1` does not. The `&&` shifts the
   effective prefix to `cmd1`.

3. **Env var poisoning**: Scan for `KEY=value command` where `command`
   would match an allow rule but `KEY=` prevents matching. Exception:
   env var prefixes that ARE in the allow list (e.g.,
   `Bash(GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=:*)`) are not toxic.

4. **`git -C` poisoning**: Scan for `git -C <path> <subcommand>`.
   The allow rule `Bash(git log:*)` won't match `git -C /foo log`.

5. **Comment prefix**: Scan for commands starting with `#` — breaks
   all allow-rule prefix matching.

6. **Hook-blocked retries**: Cross-reference unmatched commands against
   known hook rejection patterns from `~/.claude/settings.json`
   PreToolUse hooks and `~/.claude/hooks/*.py`. If a command matches
   a hook block regex, Claude should never have attempted it.
   Read the hook scripts to extract their block patterns:
   - `validate-bash-security.py` blocks: `cat >`, `cat <<`, `echo >`,
     `printf >`, shell command substitution inside eval
   - Other hooks: extract reject conditions from their source

7. **Nuisance approvals**: Commands that are safe, not structurally
   broken, but prompted because no allow rule covers them. Detected
   when the same command pattern appears 3+ times with no structural
   issue.

8. **Unnecessary `cd` in worktree**: Scan for `cd /path && command`
   where `/path` matches the session's CWD (from transcript header).
   If the session is in a worktree (`.git` is a file), `cd` into
   the worktree root is always redundant. Classification:
   `UNNECESSARY_CD_WORKTREE`. Fix: drop the `cd` prefix.

9. **Worktree CWD not switched**: After a `Dev10x:git-worktree`
   invocation in the transcript, check whether subsequent Bash
   commands target the new worktree path or still operate in the
   original repo. If commands use `cd <worktree>` or `git -C
   <worktree>` after creation, the CWD switch may have failed.
   Classification: `WORKTREE_CWD_NOT_SWITCHED`. Fix: investigate
   `Dev10x:git-worktree` skill — the EnterWorktree tool should have
   switched the session directory automatically.

**Output format:**

| # | Command (truncated) | Toxicity | Root Cause | Recommended Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `BASE=$(git merge...) && script` | PREFIX_POISONED_SUBSHELL | `$()` shifts prefix | Skill: pass `develop` directly |
| 2 | `cat <<'EOF'\n...\nEOF` | HOOK_BLOCKED_RETRY | hook blocks `cat <<` | Skill: Write + `git commit -F` |
| 3 | `mkdir -p /tmp && script` | PREFIX_POISONED_CHAIN | `&&` shifts prefix to `mkdir` | Skill: script creates own dirs |
| 4 | `git -C /work/myproject log` | PREFIX_POISONED_GIT_C | `-C` breaks `Bash(git log:*)` | Skill: use CWD |
| 5 | `pytest src/` (3x) | NUISANCE_APPROVE | No matching rule | Allow: `Bash(pytest:*)` |
| 6 | `cd /work/.worktrees/proj && pytest` | UNNECESSARY_CD_WORKTREE | CWD is already the worktree | Drop the `cd` |
| 7 | `git -C /work/.worktrees/proj log` after worktree create | WORKTREE_CWD_NOT_SWITCHED | CWD switch failed | Fix `Dev10x:git-worktree` skill |

**10. Wrapper discovery**: For each PREFIX_POISONED or chained
command finding, check whether a wrapper already exists that
encapsulates the toxic pattern:

| Wrapper source | How to check | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Git aliases | `git config --list \| grep alias\.` | `git develop-log` wraps `$(git merge-base develop HEAD)` |
| Fish functions | `ls ~/.config/fish/functions/` | `fish_func.fish` wrapping a pipeline |
| Claude tools | `ls ~/.claude/tools/` | `~/.claude/tools/helper.sh` |
| Skill scripts | `find ~/.claude/skills -name '*.sh'` | `scripts/fetch.sh` in a skill dir |

Classify each finding:

| Classification | Condition | Proposal |
|---|---|---|
| `USE_EXISTING_WRAPPER` | Wrapper found | MEMORY_UPDATE: document the wrapper invocation |
| `CREATE_WRAPPER_ALIAS` | No wrapper; git-related chain | Create git alias + MEMORY_UPDATE |
| `CREATE_WRAPPER_SCRIPT` | No wrapper; non-git chain | Create `~/.claude/tools/<name>.sh` + allow rule + MEMORY_UPDATE |

Add a **Wrapper Status** column to the output table:

| # | Command | Toxicity | Wrapper Status | Recommended Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `BASE=$(git merge-base develop HEAD) && git log` | PREFIX_POISONED_SUBSHELL | EXISTS: `git develop-log` | MEMORY_UPDATE: use `git develop-log` |
| 2 | `mkdir -p /tmp/out && ~/.claude/tools/export.sh` | PREFIX_POISONED_CHAIN | MISSING | CREATE_WRAPPER_SCRIPT: let script create dirs |
| 3 | `ENV=val ~/.claude/skills/foo/scripts/run.sh` | PREFIX_POISONED_ENVVAR | MISSING | CREATE_WRAPPER_SCRIPT: script sets env internally |

When wrapper exists, the primary recommendation is MEMORY_UPDATE
(not a new script or alias). The memory note should document:
- The toxic pattern that triggers it
- The correct invocation using the wrapper
- Where the wrapper lives (for reference)

Example memory update proposal:
```
MEMORY_UPDATE: "Use `git develop-log` instead of
`git log $(git merge-base develop HEAD)..HEAD` —
the alias wraps the subshell, keeping the command prefix stable
for allow-rule matching."
```

When no wrapper exists, propose creating one AND a memory update
documenting it. For git aliases, reference `Dev10x:git-alias-setup`
as the canonical setup mechanism rather than proposing raw
`git config` commands.

**Recommendations per category:**

- **PREFIX_POISONED_***: First check wrapper discovery (step 8
  above). If a wrapper exists, propose MEMORY_UPDATE to use it
  and SKILL_UPDATE to teach the wrapper pattern. If no wrapper
  exists, propose creating one, then update the SKILL.md that
  teaches the broken pattern. Also propose a PreToolUse hook
  (via `/hookify`) to auto-reject the pattern with a helpful
  error message pointing to the wrapper.

- **HOOK_BLOCKED_RETRY**: Update the SKILL.md to use the correct
  pattern. No new hook needed (existing hook already blocks). Add a
  memory note so Claude stops attempting the blocked pattern.

- **NUISANCE_APPROVE**: Propose an allow rule (same as Step 4f).

**Hook proposal format** (for PREFIX_POISONED findings):

When proposing a new hookify rule, provide enough context for
`/hookify` to create it:

```
Proposed hook: prevent-subshell-in-script-calls
Trigger: PreToolUse (Bash)
Pattern: command contains $() && followed by a skill script path
Action: deny
Message: "Do not use $() before skill script calls — it breaks
  allow-rule prefix matching. Pass arguments directly to the script."
Source: TICKET-58 audit — 3 user corrections for this pattern
```

**Step 4d: Load existing permissions**

Read `~/.claude/settings.local.json` and any project-level
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/settings.local.json` to get the
current `permissions.allow` list.

**Step 4e: Match analysis**

For each permission prompt, determine why it wasn't pre-approved.
First check Step 4c toxicity results — toxic commands get a structural
classification. Non-toxic commands get a rule-based classification.

**Structural classifications** (from Step 4c — no allow rule can fix):

| Classification | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **PREFIX_POISONED** | `$()`, `&&`, env vars, `git -C`, or `#` shifts the effective prefix | `BASE=$(...) && script` |
| **HOOK_BLOCKED** | An existing PreToolUse hook rejects this pattern | `cat <<'EOF'` blocked by validate-bash-security |
| **NUISANCE_PATTERN** | Safe command prompted 3+ times, structurally OK but tedious | Same `uv run` variant 4 times |

**Rule-based classifications** (fixable with allow rules):

| Classification | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **MISSING_RULE** | No allow rule covers this command/path at all | `pytest` not in allow list |
| **PATTERN_TOO_NARROW** | A rule exists for similar commands but the glob pattern doesn't match this invocation | `Bash(git log:*)` exists but `git -C /other/path log` was used |
| **PREFIX_MISMATCH** | The command starts differently than the allow pattern expects | `uv run pytest` vs `pytest` |
| **PATH_NOT_COVERED** | A Read/Write/Edit rule exists but doesn't cover this path | `Read(/work/myproject/**)` missing |
| **CORRECTLY_PROMPTED** | The command is risky and SHOULD require approval | `git push --force`, `rm -rf` |

**Priority**: Structural classifications take precedence. If a command
is PREFIX_POISONED, do NOT also classify it as PATTERN_TOO_NARROW —
the root cause is the prefix, not the rule width.

**Step 4f: Generate recommendations**

Route each finding to the right fix type based on classification:

**1. NUISANCE_APPROVE / MISSING_RULE / PATTERN_TOO_NARROW / PREFIX_MISMATCH / PATH_NOT_COVERED → Allow rule**

Propose a specific allow rule:

```
Current: (none)
Proposed: Bash(pytest:*)
Reason: pytest is a safe read-only test runner, prompted 3 times
```

Group related proposals (e.g., all `uv run` variants) into a single
recommendation. Prefer broader patterns that cover foreseeable variants
over exact-match rules, but never propose patterns that would also
pre-approve destructive commands.

**Safety guardrails — never propose allow rules for:**
- `git push`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git checkout .`
- `rm -rf`, `rm -r` on non-temp paths
- Commands that write to production databases
- Commands that send messages (Slack, email) without review
- `--force`, `--no-verify`, `--hard` flags

**2. PREFIX_POISONED → Wrapper discovery + skill update + hook**

For each PREFIX_POISONED finding, run wrapper discovery (4c step 8)
first, then route based on result:

**2a. Wrapper exists (`USE_EXISTING_WRAPPER`):**
1. Propose MEMORY_UPDATE documenting the wrapper invocation
2. Propose SKILL_UPDATE replacing the toxic pattern with the wrapper
3. No new hook or script needed — the wrapper already solves it

```
Fix type: MEMORY_UPDATE + SKILL_UPDATE
Wrapper: git develop-log (git alias)
Skill: Dev10x:some-skill (line 38)
Before: git log $(git merge-base develop HEAD)..HEAD
After:  git develop-log
Memory: "Use `git develop-log` — wraps the subshell"
```

**2b. No wrapper exists (`CREATE_WRAPPER_ALIAS` / `CREATE_WRAPPER_SCRIPT`):**
1. Propose creating the wrapper (alias via `Dev10x:git-alias-setup`
   or script in `~/.claude/tools/`)
2. Propose SKILL_UPDATE replacing the toxic pattern
3. Propose MEMORY_UPDATE documenting the new wrapper
4. If script: propose allow rule for the new path
5. Propose hookify rule to auto-reject the toxic pattern

```
Fix type: CREATE_WRAPPER + SKILL_UPDATE + HOOKIFY_RULE
Proposed: ~/.claude/tools/export-with-env.sh
Skill: Dev10x:some-skill (line 38)
Before: ENV=val ~/.claude/skills/foo/scripts/run.sh
After:  ~/.claude/tools/export-with-env.sh
Allow:  Bash(~/.claude/tools/export-with-env:*)
Hook: Reject ENV= prefix before skill scripts
Memory: "Use export-with-env.sh — sets env internally"
```

**3. HOOK_BLOCKED → Skill update + memory note**

For each HOOK_BLOCKED finding:
1. Identify the skill that teaches the blocked pattern
2. Propose a skill edit using the correct alternative
3. Propose a memory note so Claude stops attempting the pattern
4. No new hook needed — the existing hook already blocks it

```
Fix type: SKILL_UPDATE + MEMORY_NOTE
Skill: commit (Step 11)
Blocked by: validate-bash-security.py (cat << pattern)
Before: git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'...)"
After:  Write to /tmp/msg.txt, then git commit -F /tmp/msg.txt
Memory: "hookify blocks cat << — use Write + -F for commit messages"
```

**4. CORRECTLY_PROMPTED → No action**

Risky commands should require approval. No recommendation needed.

**5. REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX → Skill update**

For each REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX finding:
1. Identify the skill or shell script that uses the prefix
2. Propose removing the `uv run --script` prefix
3. If the underlying Python script lacks the proper shebang or
   permissions, propose fixing those first

```
Fix type: SKILL_UPDATE
Skill: Dev10x:some-skill (line 42)
Before: uv run --script ~/.claude/tools/some-script.py get ...
After:  ~/.claude/tools/some-script.py get ...
Prereq: script has #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script + chmod +x
```

**Step 4g: Script Shebang and Invocation Audit**

Scan all Python scripts in `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/tools/`
for shebang and invocation hygiene. Also scan SKILL.md files and shell
scripts for redundant `uv run --script` prefixes.

**Convention**: Every Python script under `~/.claude/skills/` and
`~/.claude/tools/` MUST use the self-executing shebang pattern:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = ["requests"]  # or [] for stdlib-only
# ///
```

This makes scripts executable directly (`./script.py`) without
needing a `uv run --script` prefix. The PEP 723 metadata block
is required even for stdlib-only scripts (use `dependencies = []`)
for consistency.

**Detection algorithm:**

1. **Missing uv shebang**: Find Python scripts (`.py`) under
   `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/tools/` whose shebang is
   `#!/usr/bin/env python3` or `#!/usr/bin/python3` instead of
   `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`. Classification:
   `WRONG_SHEBANG`.

2. **Missing PEP 723 metadata**: Find scripts with the correct
   uv shebang but no `# /// script` block. Classification:
   `MISSING_PEP723`.

3. **Missing execute permission**: Find scripts that are not
   executable (`! -x`). Classification: `NOT_EXECUTABLE`.

4. **Redundant `uv run --script` prefix in SKILL.md**: Grep
   SKILL.md files for `uv run --script` invocations of scripts
   that already have the self-executing shebang. Classification:
   `REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX`.

5. **Redundant `uv run --script` prefix in shell scripts**: Grep
   `scripts/*.sh` files for `uv run --script` invocations.
   Classification: `REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX_SHELL`.

**Output format:**

| # | Script / Caller | Issue | Classification | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `tools/some-script.py` | `#!/usr/bin/env python3` | WRONG_SHEBANG | Change to uv shebang + PEP 723 |
| 2 | `tools/upload-screenshots.py` | Has deps but python3 shebang | WRONG_SHEBANG | Change shebang (deps already in PEP 723) |
| 3 | `scripts/fernet-decrypt.py` | mode 644 | NOT_EXECUTABLE | `chmod +x` |
| 4 | `Dev10x:some-skill/SKILL.md` | `uv run --script ~/.claude/tools/...` | REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX | Drop prefix |
| 5 | `Dev10x:some-skill/scripts/notify.sh` | `uv run --script ...slack-notify.py` | REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX_SHELL | Drop prefix |

**Recommendations:**

- **WRONG_SHEBANG**: Fix the shebang to
  `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` and add PEP 723 block.
  If the script has external deps, they go in `dependencies = [...]`.
  If stdlib-only, use `dependencies = []`.
- **MISSING_PEP723**: Add the `# /// script` block after the shebang.
- **NOT_EXECUTABLE**: Run `chmod +x <script>`.
- **REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX**: Update the SKILL.md or shell script to
  call the Python script directly without the `uv run --script`
  prefix. This simplifies allow-rule matching — the command prefix
  becomes the script path, not `uv`.
- **REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX_SHELL**: Same as above but in `.sh` files.

**Why direct invocation matters for allow rules:**

```
# With prefix — allow rule must match "uv run":
Bash(uv run --script ~/.claude/tools/some-script.py:*)

# Without prefix — allow rule matches the script path directly:
Bash(~/.claude/tools/some-script.py:*)
```

The second form is simpler, more specific, and follows the same
pattern as skill scripts under `Bash(~/.claude/skills/<name>/scripts/:*)`.

**Summary table format:**

| # | Classification | Fix Type | Target | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | PREFIX_POISONED (wrapper exists) | Memory + Skill | `Dev10x:some-skill` | USE_EXISTING_WRAPPER: `git develop-log` |
| 2 | PREFIX_POISONED (no wrapper) | Wrapper + Skill + Hook | `~/.claude/tools/` | CREATE_WRAPPER_SCRIPT + hookify |
| 3 | HOOK_BLOCKED | Skill + Memory | `commit` | Replace heredoc with Write + -F |
| 4 | MISSING_RULE | Allow rule | `settings.local.json` | Add `Bash(pytest:*)` |
| 5 | CORRECTLY_PROMPTED | None | — | `git push` should require approval |
| 6 | REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX | Skill update | `Dev10x:some-skill` | Drop `uv run --script` prefix |
| 7 | WRONG_SHEBANG | Script fix | `tools/script.py` | Add uv shebang + PEP 723 |

#### Phase 5: Lessons Learned Extraction

Review user corrections and `[CORRECTION]` markers:

1. For each correction, determine:
   - What did Claude do wrong?
   - What did the user want instead?
   - One-off preference or repeatable pattern?
   - Which skill should encode this lesson?

2. Check memory directory for existing notes on the topic.

3. Classify each lesson:
   - **SKILL_UPDATE**: Add to an existing SKILL.md
   - **NEW_SKILL**: Warrants a new skill
   - **MEMORY_UPDATE**: Add to memory (not skill-specific)
   - **CLAUDE_MD_UPDATE**: Add to CLAUDE.md (global rule)
   - **NO_ACTION**: One-off, not worth persisting

---

#### Phase 6: Propose Changes (REQUIRES USER CONFIRMATION)

**Runs in main agent after Step 8 (collect and synthesize).**

Read all five phase output files to gather the complete findings.
Merge them into a unified view before presenting proposals.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT modify any files without user confirmation.**

1. Present each proposed change clearly:
   - Which file to modify
   - What to add/change/remove
   - Why (reference the specific transcript turn)

2. Use AskUserQuestion to confirm each change (or batch related changes).

3. If approved, edit the files. For new skills, suggest using `/Dev10x:skill-create`.

4. **REQUIRED: File a GitHub issue for every actionable finding.**
   After presenting the summary, iterate over all findings
   classified as SKILL_UPDATE, GAP, or SKIPPED_STEP. For each:
   - Invoke `Skill(Dev10x:ticket-create)` with:
     - Title: `[<classification>] <affected skill>: <short description>`
     - Body: finding classification, affected skill, description
       of the gap/deviation, recommended fix, and session evidence
   - Do NOT gate behind `AskUserQuestion` — filing is mandatory
   - Report all created issue URLs in the final summary

5. Generate a summary report:
   - Total actions reviewed
   - Skills invoked vs missed vs gaps
   - Compliance score (% of steps followed correctly)
   - Permission prompts: total, avoidable, proposed rules
   - Changes applied (skill updates + permission rules)
   - Issues filed (with URLs)
   - Recommendations for future sessions

---

#### Phase 7: Upstream Reporting (optional delegation)

**Runs in main agent after Phase 6 completes.**

Check whether any findings warrant reporting to the Dev10x
plugin maintainers.

**Sub-step A: Collect upstream-relevant findings**

Scan all findings from Phases 2–6 and select those that relate
to Dev10x plugin skills (under `~/.claude/plugins/`). Include:
- `SKILL_UPDATE`, `GAP`, `SKIPPED_STEP`
- `DEVIATED` with assessment `regression`
- `PREFIX_POISONED_*`, `HOOK_BLOCKED_RETRY`, `REDUNDANT_UV_PREFIX`

Exclude findings about user-local skills (`~/.claude/skills/`),
memory files, or `settings.local.json` — those are local-only.

If no upstream-relevant findings exist, mark Phase 7 completed.

**Sub-step B: Ask user whether to report**

**REQUIRED: invoke `AskUserQuestion` tool** (not a plain text
question) to ask whether to file upstream. Present the count
of upstream-relevant findings and two options: "File issue
(Recommended)" to delegate to `Dev10x:audit-report`, or
"Skip" to keep findings local only.

If the user selects **Skip**, mark Phase 7 completed and end.

**Sub-step C: Delegate to Dev10x:audit-report**

Write a findings summary to a temp file so the delegated
skill can read it without needing the full transcript:

```bash
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh skill-audit findings .md
```

Write the upstream-relevant findings table and proposed fixes
to that file, then invoke:

```
Skill(skill="Dev10x:audit-report", args="<findings-file-path>")
```

The `Dev10x:audit-report` skill handles version detection,
issue body generation, and `gh issue create`. Mark Phase 7
completed after delegation returns.

## Important Rules

- **Read-only by default**: Only modify files after explicit user approval
- **Be specific**: Reference exact transcript turns and skill file lines
- **Prioritize impact**: Focus on deviations that caused real problems, not nitpicks
- **Respect intent**: If the user's correction was clearly better, update the skill.
  If it was situational, note it but don't change the default.
- **No duplicate memory**: Check existing memory/CLAUDE.md before proposing additions
- **Inline script extraction**: Phase 4b detects inline shell/python blocks in
  skill SKILL.md files and session Bash calls. For each `EXTRACT_TO_SKILL_SCRIPT`
  finding, propose: (1) moving the block to `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/scripts/`,
  (2) updating SKILL.md to call the script, (3) adding a
  `Bash(~/.claude/skills/<skill>/scripts/:*)` allow rule so future runs need zero
  approval prompts. Reference `Dev10x:some-skill/scripts/triage.py` as the canonical
  example of a skill that already does this correctly.
- **Structural before rule-based**: When analyzing permission friction, always
  check Step 4c toxicity first. A PREFIX_POISONED command should never get a
  "widen the allow rule" recommendation — the fix is the skill pattern, not
  the rule. Proposing allow rules for structurally broken commands is a false
  fix that will fail on the next invocation.
- **Hook proposals are skill-coupled**: Every hookify rule proposal must come
  with a corresponding skill update that teaches the correct pattern. A hook
  that blocks a bad pattern without showing the alternative just shifts the
  friction from "approve?" to "what now?".
- **Script shebang hygiene**: Phase 4g scans Python scripts for proper
  self-executing setup. All scripts under `~/.claude/skills/` and
  `~/.claude/tools/` must use `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` shebang
  + PEP 723 metadata + executable permission. SKILL.md files and shell
  scripts must NOT prefix these scripts with `uv run --script` — the
  prefix is redundant and breaks allow-rule prefix matching.
- **Prefer jq/yq over Python scripts**: When a hook or skill script
  only does JSON/YAML parsing, prefer `jq` or `yq` over inline
  `python3 -c "import json..."`. Flag Python one-liners that could be
  replaced with a single `jq`/`yq` invocation as `PREFER_JQ_YQ`.
- **Upstream reporting scope**: Phase 7 only considers findings
  about Dev10x plugin skills (under `~/.claude/plugins/`). User-
  local skills, memory updates, and permission rule changes are
  local-only and never filed upstream.
- **Delegation over embedding**: Phase 7 delegates issue filing to
  `Dev10x:audit-report` rather than implementing it inline. This
  keeps skill-audit focused on analysis and lets users who don't
  want upstream reporting skip the skill entirely.
