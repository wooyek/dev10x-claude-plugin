# Python Test Verifier

## Overview

Run the test suite and verify all tests pass with 100% coverage
for new code. Reports concise summaries — detailed output only on
failures.

## When to Use

- Code changes need test verification before committing
- Before creating a pull request
- Explicitly asked to run tests or check coverage
- After implementing fixes to verify they work

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run Tests

```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Worktree sessions:** When the session CWD is inside a worktree
(`.git` is a file, not a directory), prefix with `uv run`:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Step 2: Parse Results

Extract:
- Total tests run
- Tests passed/failed
- Coverage percentage
- Uncovered lines (if any)

### Step 3: Report Summary

**If all tests pass:**
```
Tests: 150 passed
Coverage: 100%
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests: 148 passed, 2 failed

Failed tests:
1. test_calculate_total - AssertionError: expected 100, got 99
2. test_validate_input - ValueError: invalid input

Coverage: 98% (missing: src/service.py:45-48)
```

## Coverage Enforcement

If coverage is below 100% for files changed in the current branch,
the branch introduced the regression. Report the failure and fix
the gap — do not ask the user whether to proceed with coverage
below 100%.

## Important Notes

- Always run tests before committing
- Ensure 100% coverage for new code
- Fix failing tests before creating PR
- Use `-v` flag for verbose output when debugging
