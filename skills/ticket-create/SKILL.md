# Create Issue Tracker Ticket

## Overview

This skill creates a well-structured ticket in GitHub Issues, Linear, or JIRA with proper formatting, comprehensive description, and appropriate labels. It ensures consistent ticket quality across all creation contexts.

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.
Create a task at invocation, mark completed when done:

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Create issue tracker ticket", activeForm="Creating ticket")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

## Prerequisites Check

Determine which tracker to use. Priority:

1. **Explicit argument** — user specifies `--github`, `--linear`, or `--jira`
2. **detect-tracker.sh** — if a ticket prefix is available (from branch name),
   run detection to match the project's tracker
3. **Repo default** — if no prefix, check autolinks to determine project's
   primary tracker. GitHub Issues if no autolinks exist.

| Tracker | Required | Creation method |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| GitHub | `gh` CLI | `gh issue create` |
| Linear | Linear MCP | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__save_issue` |
| JIRA | `JIRA_TENANT` + keyring | `jira-update.sh` (requires external `dev10x:jira` skill) |

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a ticket for tech debt that needs tracking
- Converting an untracked change into a formal ticket
- Creating a bug report ticket
- Documenting an improvement or enhancement
- Need a properly structured ticket with consistent formatting

## Input Requirements

This skill requires:
1. **Context** - Information about the problem/improvement (can be from a commit, code analysis, or user description)
2. **Optional: Title** - If not provided, generate from context
3. **Optional: Labels** - If not provided, infer from context

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Context

Understand what the ticket is about from the provided context:

**Context can come from:**
- Git commit diff and message (`git show <commit-hash>`)
- Code files that need improvement
- User description of the problem
- Bug report or issue description

**Extract:**
- What problem is being solved?
- Why did the issue exist?
- What changes were/will be made?
- What files are affected?

### Step 2: Generate Ticket Title

Create a descriptive, concise title following these patterns:

**Title Format Patterns:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Tech debt | "Fix tech debt in..." | "Fix tech debt in TestAddTireService flaky tests" |
| Bug fix | "Fix bug in..." | "Fix bug in payment processing timeout handling" |
| Enhancement | "Improve..." | "Improve customer search performance" |
| Refactoring | "Refactor..." | "Refactor invoice generation service" |
| Test improvement | "Fix flaky test in..." | "Fix flaky test in work order creation" |
| Missing feature | "Add..." | "Add retry mechanism for Square API" |

**Title Rules:**
- Keep concise but descriptive (aim for < 80 characters)
- Start with action verb (Fix, Improve, Add, Refactor, etc.)
- Be specific about the component/area affected
- Avoid vague terms like "issue" or "problem" without context
- **Describe the user-facing outcome, not the implementation detail.** E.g., `Enable automatic terminal discovery` not `Add DEVICES_READ to Square OAuth scopes`

### Step 3: Generate Description

Create a comprehensive description using this structure:

**Structure:**
```markdown
<Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the problem/improvement>

## Root Cause
- <Primary reason the issue existed>
- <Contributing factors>
- <Technical details about why this happened>

## Solution
- <First key change or improvement>
- <Second key change or improvement>
- <Third key change or improvement>
- <Additional changes as needed>

## Files Changed
- <file path 1> - <what changed>
- <file path 2> - <what changed>
- <file path 3> - <what changed>
```

### Step 4: Determine Labels

Select appropriate labels based on the context:

**Available Labels:**

| Label | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `tech-debt` | Technical improvements, refactoring, code quality issues |
| `bug` | Production bugs, incorrect behavior, errors |
| `testing` | Test improvements, test infrastructure, test coverage |
| `flaky-tests` | Tests that fail intermittently. **Always use for flaky test tickets** alongside `Bug` |
| `performance` | Performance optimizations, slow queries |
| `documentation` | Documentation updates, missing docs |
| `security` | Security vulnerabilities, auth issues |

### Step 5: Create the Ticket

Dispatch to the detected tracker:

**GitHub Issues:**
```bash
gh issue create --repo "$REPO" --title "$TITLE" --body "$DESCRIPTION" --label "$LABELS"
```

**Linear:**
```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__save_issue(
    team: "TEAM_UUID",
    title: TITLE,
    description: DESCRIPTION,
    labels: [LABELS]
)
```

**JIRA:**

> Requires the external `dev10x:jira` skill installed at `~/.claude/skills/`.

```bash
~/.claude/skills/dev10x:jira/scripts/jira-update.sh "$TICKET_ID" /tmp/claude/jira-payload.json
```

> Team-specific IDs are documented in the tracker skill (`dev10x:linear`, `dev10x:jira`).

### Step 6: Return Ticket Information

Extract and return the ticket details:

```
Ticket Created

Tracker: {GitHub Issues | Linear | JIRA}
ID: {GH-42 | PAY-519 | TT-1234}
Title: {title}
URL: {tracker-specific URL}
```

## Important Notes

- Keep titles concise but descriptive
- Always include Root Cause, Solution, and Files Changed sections
- Apply relevant labels to improve discoverability
- Return the ticket ID for use in subsequent workflows
- Don't modify ticket after creation unless explicitly asked

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is designed to be used by other skills:

- **commit:to-new-ticket**: Uses this skill in Step 3 to create ticket from commit
- **test:fix-flaky**: Uses this skill in Step 3 to create tech debt ticket
- **Standalone usage**: User manually creates ticket with provided context
