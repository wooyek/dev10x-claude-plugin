# Create Issue Tracker Ticket

## Overview

This skill creates a well-structured ticket in GitHub Issues, Linear, or JIRA with proper formatting, comprehensive description, and appropriate labels. It ensures consistent ticket quality across all creation contexts.

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.
Create a task at invocation, mark completed when done:

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Create issue tracker ticket", activeForm="Creating ticket")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

## Prerequisites Check

Determine which tracker to use. Priority:

1. **Explicit argument** — user specifies `--github`, `--linear`, or `--jira`
2. **detect_tracker MCP tool** — if a ticket prefix is available (from branch
   name), call `mcp__plugin_Dev10x_cli__detect_tracker` to match the project's
   tracker
3. **Repo default** — if no prefix, check autolinks to determine project's
   primary tracker. GitHub Issues if no autolinks exist.

| Tracker | Required | Creation method |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| GitHub | `gh` CLI | `gh issue create` |
| Linear | Linear MCP | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__save_issue` |
| JIRA | `JIRA_TENANT` + keyring | Delegate to `Dev10x:jira` skill |

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a ticket for tech debt that needs tracking
- Converting an untracked change into a formal ticket
- Creating a bug report ticket
- Documenting an improvement or enhancement
- Need a properly structured ticket with consistent formatting

## Input Requirements

This skill requires:
1. **Context** - Information about the problem/improvement (can be from a commit, code analysis, or user description)
2. **Optional: Title** - If not provided, generate from context.
   When `--body-file` is used without `--title`, the first line
   of the file is used as the title (separated from the body by
   a blank line). This avoids permission friction from special
   characters in args strings.
3. **Optional: Labels** - If not provided, infer from context

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Context

Understand what the ticket is about from the provided context:

**Context can come from:**
- Git commit diff and message (`git show <commit-hash>`)
- Code files that need improvement
- User description of the problem
- Bug report or issue description

**Extract:**
- What problem is being solved?
- Why did the issue exist?
- What changes were/will be made?
- What files are affected?

### Step 2: Generate Ticket Title

Create a descriptive, concise title following these patterns:

**Title Format Patterns:**

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Tech debt | "Fix tech debt in..." | "Fix tech debt in TestAddTireService flaky tests" |
| Bug fix | "Fix bug in..." | "Fix bug in payment processing timeout handling" |
| Enhancement | "Improve..." | "Improve customer search performance" |
| Refactoring | "Refactor..." | "Refactor invoice generation service" |
| Test improvement | "Fix flaky test in..." | "Fix flaky test in work order creation" |
| Missing feature | "Add..." | "Add retry mechanism for Square API" |

**Title Rules:**
- Keep concise but descriptive (aim for < 80 characters)
- Start with action verb (Fix, Improve, Add, Refactor, etc.)
- Be specific about the component/area affected
- Avoid vague terms like "issue" or "problem" without context
- **Describe the user-facing outcome, not the implementation detail.** E.g., `Enable automatic terminal discovery` not `Add DEVICES_READ to Square OAuth scopes`

### Step 3: Generate Description

Create a comprehensive description using this structure:

**Structure:**
```markdown
<Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the problem/improvement>

## Root Cause
- <Primary reason the issue existed>
- <Contributing factors>
- <Technical details about why this happened>

## Solution
- <First key change or improvement>
- <Second key change or improvement>
- <Third key change or improvement>
- <Additional changes as needed>

## Files Changed
- <file path 1> - <what changed>
- <file path 2> - <what changed>
- <file path 3> - <what changed>
```

### Step 4: Determine Labels

Select appropriate labels based on the context:

**Available Labels:**

| Label | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `tech-debt` | Technical improvements, refactoring, code quality issues |
| `bug` | Production bugs, incorrect behavior, errors |
| `testing` | Test improvements, test infrastructure, test coverage |
| `flaky-tests` | Tests that fail intermittently. **Always use for flaky test tickets** alongside `Bug` |
| `performance` | Performance optimizations, slow queries |
| `documentation` | Documentation updates, missing docs |
| `security` | Security vulnerabilities, auth issues |

### Step 5: Create the Ticket

**REQUIRED:** Delegate ticket creation to a background haiku agent.
This prevents raw API responses (full issue JSON, project lookups)
from consuming main session context. The agent returns only the
ticket ID and URL.

**Dispatch:**

```
Agent(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    model="haiku",
    description="Create {tracker} ticket: {short_title}",
    prompt="""
    Create a ticket with the following details:

    Tracker: {tracker_type}
    Title: {title}
    Description: {description}
    Labels: {labels}
    {tracker-specific config: team UUID, project UUID, repo}

    {include the tracker-specific instructions below}

    Return ONLY:
    - Tracker: {GitHub Issues | Linear | JIRA}
    - ID: {ticket ID}
    - URL: {ticket URL}
    Do NOT return full API response bodies.
    """,
    run_in_background=true
)
```

The main session waits for the agent result and passes it to
Step 6. The tracker-specific instructions below describe what
the agent executes — include the relevant section in its prompt.

**Nested invocation:** When invoked from a background agent
(e.g., from `project-scope`'s Phase 3 agent), skip the
delegation wrapper and execute creation directly. Detection:
if the skill is running as a Skill() call within an Agent()
prompt (vs. in main session), this SKILL.md is your read
context — your caller (the agent prompt) already optimizes
the session context, so you execute creation directly per
tracker-specific instructions below without wrapping in
Agent().

**Tracker-specific creation instructions:**

Dispatch to the detected tracker:

**GitHub Issues:**

Write the description to a temp file first (inline `--body` strings
break shell quoting on markdown tables and long descriptions):
```bash
# Generate temp path via mktmp.sh, then write body via Write tool
BODY_FILE=$(/tmp/Dev10x/bin/mktmp.sh gh-issue body .md)
# Write description content to $BODY_FILE via the Write tool
gh issue create --repo "$REPO" --title "$TITLE" --body-file "$BODY_FILE" --label "$LABELS"
```

**Title-in-file convention:** When the caller provides
`--body-file` without `--title`, use the wrapper script that
reads line 1 as the title and creates the issue in one call
(like `git commit -F`):
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ticket-create/scripts/create-github-issue.sh "$BODY_FILE" "$REPO" "$LABELS"
```
This avoids passing titles with special characters in args
strings, which can cause permission friction.

**Linear:**

If a `project` parameter was provided by the caller, resolve the
project UUID first via `list_projects(team: "TEAM_UUID")` — never
pass a display name (name matching is exact and fails silently).
After creation, verify linkage with `get_issue(id)` and confirm
`projectId` matches the expected UUID. See `Dev10x:linear`
§ Project Assignment.

```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__save_issue(
    team: "TEAM_UUID",
    title: TITLE,
    description: DESCRIPTION,
    labels: [LABELS],
    project: "PROJECT_UUID"  # optional — resolved UUID only
)
```

**JIRA:**

Delegate to the `Dev10x:jira` skill:

```
Skill(skill="Dev10x:jira")
```

Pass the ticket ID and payload path as arguments.

> Team-specific IDs are documented in the tracker skill (`Dev10x:linear`, `Dev10x:jira`).

### Step 6: Return Ticket Information

Extract and return the ticket details:

```
Ticket Created

Tracker: {GitHub Issues | Linear | JIRA}
ID: {GH-42 | PAY-519 | TT-1234}
Title: {title}
URL: {tracker-specific URL}
```

## Important Notes

- Keep titles concise but descriptive
- Always include Root Cause, Solution, and Files Changed sections
- Apply relevant labels to improve discoverability
- Return the ticket ID for use in subsequent workflows
- Don't modify ticket after creation unless explicitly asked
