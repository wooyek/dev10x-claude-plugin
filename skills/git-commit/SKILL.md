# Create Commit

## Overview

This skill creates properly formatted git commits following project conventions:
- Gitmoji prefix based on change type
- Ticket reference extracted from branch name
- 72 character title limit
- Structured body with solution points
- Proper footer with ticket reference

## Guiding Principle: User-Facing Outcomes

**Shift the perspective from what changed in the code to what it enables for the user.** The same principle drives Job Stories — the "so I can" clause captures the outcome, not the mechanism. This applies to commit titles, PR titles, ticket titles, and branch grooming.

- Bad: `Add DEVICES_READ to Square OAuth scopes` (implementation)
- Good: `Enable automatic terminal discovery` (outcome)
- Bad: `Add Square location ID GraphQL query` (implementation)
- Good: `Enable multi-location payment routing` (outcome)
- Bad: `Add customer_id column to invoices table` (implementation)
- Good: `Link invoices to customer records` (outcome)

## Prerequisites Check

**IMPORTANT:** Verify git state before committing:

1. Check if we're in a git repository
2. Check if there are staged or unstaged changes
3. Check current branch (should not be develop/main/master)
4. Verify branch follows naming convention (username/TICKET-ID/description)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Ready to commit changes with proper formatting
- Want to ensure commit follows project conventions
- Need help formatting commit message
- Want ticket reference auto-extracted from branch

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Git State

**Check repository status:**
```bash
# Verify in git repo
git rev-parse --git-dir

# Get current branch
BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)

# Check for changes
git status --porcelain
```

**Validations:**
- ❌ If not in git repo → Error: "Not in a git repository"
- ❌ If on develop/main/master → Error: "Cannot commit directly to develop/main/master"
- ❌ If no changes → Error: "No changes to commit"
- ✅ If staged changes exist → Continue
- ⚠️ If only unstaged changes → Ask: "Stage all changes? (y/n)"

### Step 2: Extract Ticket ID from Branch

**Branch naming convention:** `username/TICKET-ID/description`

**Examples:**
- `janusz/PAY-133/fix-motor-timeout` → `PAY-133`
- `janusz/ENG-42/add-retry-mechanism` → `ENG-42`

**Extraction:**
```bash
# Extract ticket ID (second segment)
TICKET_ID=$(git branch --show-current | cut -d'/' -f2)

# Validate format (TEAM-NUMBER)
if [[ ! $TICKET_ID =~ ^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "⚠️  Warning: Could not extract ticket ID from branch name"
  echo "Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
  echo "Expected format: username/TICKET-ID/description"
fi
```

**If extraction fails:**
- Ask user: "What is the ticket ID? (e.g., PAY-133)"
- Use provided ticket ID

**If no ticket (technical branch):**
- Commits without ticket reference are allowed
- Skip ticket prompts

### Step 2.5: Optional JTBD Title Derivation

This step activates when **any** of these conditions are met:
- **Explicit request:** User passes "use dx:jtbd" (or similar) in `/dx:git-commit` args
- **First commit:** Ticket ID extracted, zero commits ahead of develop, and
  commit type is Feature (✨) or Bug (🐛)

**Flow:**
1. Invoke the `dx:jtbd` base skill in **unattended** mode with `ticket_id`
2. Extract the "so I can" clause from the returned story
3. Transform it to an imperative title (e.g., "so I can track Zelle transactions" → "Enable Zelle transaction tracking")
4. Present as a suggestion:
   ```
   Suggested title: Enable Zelle transaction tracking
   Accept? (Enter = yes, or type your own)
   ```
5. If user accepts → use as the commit title description (Step 4 is pre-filled)
6. If user types their own → use that instead

**Skip entirely** when not explicitly requested AND it's a subsequent commit,
refactor, test, docs, or config change — keeping those fast. Also skip when a
Job Story was already sourced from the Linear ticket earlier in this session
(e.g., during `ticket:work-on`) — invoking the `jtbd` skill again is redundant.

### Step 3: Determine Commit Type

**Orchestrated mode:** When this skill is invoked by an orchestrating skill
(e.g., `test:fix-flaky`, `dx:git-commit-to-new-ticket`) and the commit type is
unambiguous from context, auto-select the type and description without
interactive prompts. Present the result in the preview (Step 9) for review.

**Ask user to select commit type:**
```
What type of change is this?

1. ✅ Test - Adding/updating/fixing tests
2. 🐛 Bug - Bug fixes
3. ♻️ Refactor - Code refactoring
4. ✨ Feature - New features
5. 📝 Docs - Documentation
6. 🔒 Security - Security fixes
7. ⚡ Performance - Performance improvements
8. 💄 UI - UI/styling updates
9. 🔧 Config - Configuration changes
10. Other (specify gitmoji)

Select number (1-10):
```

**Gitmoji mapping:**
- 1 → ✅ (`:white_check_mark:`)
- 2 → 🐛 (`:bug:`)
- 3 → ♻️ (`:recycle:`)
- 4 → ✨ (`:sparkles:`)
- 5 → 📝 (`:memo:`)
- 6 → 🔒 (`:lock:`)
- 7 → ⚡ (`:zap:`)
- 8 → 💄 (`:lipstick:`)
- 9 → 🔧 (`:wrench:`)
- 10 → Ask: "Enter gitmoji (e.g., 🎨)"

### Step 4: Get Commit Description

**Ask user:**
```
Short description (will be title line):
[User types description]
```

**Validate:**
- Calculate total length: `gitmoji + space + TICKET-ID + space + description`
- If > 72 chars → Ask: "Title is {X} characters (max 72). Please shorten the description."
- Iterate until ≤ 72 chars

**JTBD self-check (mandatory):** Before accepting the description, verify it
describes the **user-facing outcome**, not the implementation action. A
PreToolUse hook will block implementation-focused verbs at commit time, but
catch them earlier here to avoid the round-trip.

| Blocked verb | Example bad title | JTBD rewrite |
|---|---|---|
| Add | "Add retry logic" | "Enable automatic retry on failure" |
| Update | "Update OAuth scopes" | "Enable terminal discovery" |
| Remove | "Remove dead code" | "Simplify payment flow" |
| Refactor | "Refactor repository" | "Simplify repository hierarchy" |
| Move/Rename | "Move factory to utils" | "Enable shared factory access" |
| Synchronize | "Sync skill with source" | "Enable dual-mode workflow" |

If the description starts with an implementation verb, rewrite it before
proceeding. Use outcome verbs: **Enable, Allow, Support, Prevent, Ensure,
Simplify, Improve, Resolve, Streamline, Protect, Stabilize, Automate**.

**Example titles:**
- `✅ PAY-310 Stabilize tax amount tests` (38 chars)
- `🐛 PAY-133 Resolve motor timeout in payments` (46 chars)
- `♻️ PAY-200 Simplify payment repository hierarchy` (50 chars)

### Step 5: Get Problem Explanation

**If the problem and solution are already known from prior context** in the
session (e.g., from a preceding scope, code review, or ticket investigation),
auto-generate Steps 5-6 rather than asking redundant questions. Present the
pre-filled content in the preview (Step 9) for user review.

**Important:** Auto-generation applies only to Steps 5 and 6. Step 9
(preview + confirm) is **always** shown to the user, even when the
commit message was fully auto-generated from session context.

**Otherwise, ask user:**
```
Detailed explanation of the problem being solved:
(What was wrong? Why did it need fixing? Context?)

[User provides explanation - can be multiple lines]
```

**Guidance:**
- Explain WHAT was wrong
- Explain WHY it needed fixing
- Provide context
- 2-4 sentences typically sufficient

**Example:**
```
Tests in TestAddTireServiceIndividual and TestAddTireServiceMultiple
were marked as flaky because they randomly failed when tax amounts
or percentages were generated as zero by Faker.
```

### Step 6: Get Solution Points

**Ask user:**
```
Solution points (what did you change?):
Enter each point on a new line. Type 'done' when finished.

1: [User enters first point]
2: [User enters second point]
3: [User enters third point]
done
```

**Format each point:**
- Start with `-` (bullet point)
- Be specific about what changed
- Include file names if relevant

**Example:**
```
- Added non_zero trait to MoneyFaker with min_value=Decimal('0.01')
- Updated test fixtures to ensure tax amounts and percentages >= 0.01
- Removed @pytest.mark.flaky decorators
```

### Step 7: Generate Complete Commit Message

**Assemble message:**
```
<gitmoji> <TICKET-ID> <description>

<problem explanation>

Solution:
<solution points>

Fixes: <TICKET-ID>
```

**Example:**
```
✅ PAY-310 Fix flaky tests with non-zero tax amounts

Tests in TestAddTireServiceIndividual and TestAddTireServiceMultiple
were marked as flaky because they randomly failed when tax amounts
or percentages were generated as zero by Faker.

Solution:
- Added non_zero trait to MoneyFaker with min_value=Decimal('0.01')
- Updated test fixtures to ensure tax amounts and percentages >= 0.01
- Removed @pytest.mark.flaky decorators

Fixes: PAY-310
```

### Step 8: Validate Line Lengths (72 char limit)

**IMPORTANT:** Before showing preview, validate ALL lines are ≤ 72 characters.

**Validation command:**
```bash
# Check each line of the commit message
echo "$COMMIT_MESSAGE" | awk '
  length > 72 {
    print "❌ Line " NR " too long (" length " chars): " $0
    fail = 1
  }
  END { exit fail }
'
```

**If any line exceeds 72 characters:**
1. Show which line(s) are too long with character count
2. Ask user to shorten the offending line(s)
3. Re-validate until all lines pass

**Quick length check for a single line:**
```bash
echo "your line here" | awk '{print length " chars"}'
```

**Common fixes for long lines:**
- Split into multiple bullet points
- Use shorter synonyms
- Move details to next line
- Abbreviate file paths (just filename, not full path)

**Example validation output:**
```
❌ Line 7 too long (77 chars): - Rename stages: base-os → system-base, base-python → python-dependencies

Suggestion: Split into two lines or shorten:
- Rename stages for clarity (system-base, python-dependencies)
```

### Step 9: Show Preview and Confirm

**This step is mandatory — never skip it, even when Steps 5-6 were
auto-generated from session context.**

**Display formatted message:**
```
Preview of commit message:
─────────────────────────────────
<formatted message>
─────────────────────────────────

Create this commit? (y/n/edit)
- y: Create commit
- n: Cancel
- edit: Modify the message
```

**If edit:**
- Ask which part to edit (title/explanation/solution)
- Re-prompt for that section
- Show new preview

### Step 10: Stage Files (if needed)

**If unstaged changes exist:**
```bash
# Show what will be staged
git status --short

# Ask user
echo "Stage all changes? (y/n/select)"
- y: git add .
- n: Only commit already staged files
- select: Ask which files to stage
```

**If select:**
```bash
# List unstaged files
git diff --name-only

# User selects files (space-separated)
# Stage selected files
git add file1 file2 file3
```

### Step 11: Create the Commit

**Use Write tool + `-F` to preserve formatting (hookify blocks heredocs):**

1. Write the commit message to a temp file using the Write tool:
   ```
   Write /tmp/claude/commit-msg.txt:
   <gitmoji> <TICKET-ID> <description>

   <problem explanation>

   Solution:
   <solution point 1>
   <solution point 2>
   <solution point 3>

   Fixes: <TICKET-ID>
   ```

2. Create the commit from the file:
   ```bash
   git commit -F /tmp/claude/commit-msg.txt
   ```

**Verify success:**
```bash
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ Commit created successfully"
  git log -1 --oneline
else
  echo "❌ Commit failed"
  # Show error
fi
```

### Step 12: Next Steps

**Ask user:**
```
Commit created successfully!

Next steps:
1. Continue working
2. Create another commit
3. Create PR (/dx:gh-pr-create)

What would you like to do? (1/2/3/done)
```

**If 3 (Create PR):**
- Use `dx:gh-pr-create` skill
- PR title will use this commit message

## Important Notes

- **No Co-Authoring:** Never add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" footer (per CLAUDE.md)
- **72 char limit:** ALL lines strictly enforced (title AND body)
- **Always validate:** Run `echo "line" | awk '{print length}'` before committing
- **Ticket extraction:** Automatic from branch name
- **Gitmoji format:** Use emoji character, not :code:
- **Footer:** Always include `Fixes: TICKET-ID`
- **Spacing:** One space after gitmoji, one space after ticket ID
- **Never `git -C <path>`**: Always use plain `git` from the session
  CWD. `git -C` breaks allow-rule matching in `settings.local.json`
  and forces permission prompts after every fresh session start.
- **Never chain `git add && git commit`**: Use two separate Bash tool
  calls — one to stage, one to commit. Same rule applies to
  `git add && git rebase --continue`. Each call must stand alone.
