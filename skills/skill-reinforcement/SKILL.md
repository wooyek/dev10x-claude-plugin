# Dev10x:skill-reinforcement

Quick reinforcement nudge when an agent reaches for CLI commands
instead of using available skills or MCP tools.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- The agent ran a CLI command that a skill already handles
- You rejected a command and want the agent to use a skill instead
- You approved a command but want to reinforce the skill habit
- You want to say "use the skills" with a structured response

## Orchestration

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Reinforce skill usage", activeForm="Reinforcing")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the offending command

Scan the recent conversation for the CLI command that triggered
this invocation. Look for:
- The most recent `Bash` tool call that was rejected or approved
- Any command the user flagged as wrong
- If the user provided arguments (e.g., `/Dev10x:skill-reinforcement kubectl`),
  use that as the command identifier

Store the command string for matching.

### Step 2: Match against command-skill map

Read the command-skill mapping from the canonical location:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/bash_validators/command-skill-map.yaml`.

The YAML in `skills/skill-reinforcement/references/command-skill-map.yaml`
is a legacy copy — prefer the hook's YAML which is the single
source of truth.

Match the identified command against the `patterns` list in each
mapping entry. Use prefix matching — if the command starts with
any pattern in the list, it matches that entry.

If no match is found in the map, fall back to Step 3.

### Step 2b: Check workflow context

If a pattern match is found but the command appears to be a valid
part of the currently active skill's documented workflow, check
whether the skill says to **delegate** for this case:

- Read the active skill's SKILL.md (if identifiable from context)
- Check if the command matches a delegation point marked with
  `REQUIRED: Skill()` — a command can be valid syntax within
  a skill but still a violation if the skill mandates delegation
  to a sub-skill for that operation
- Example: `gh api --method POST .../replies` is documented in
  `gh-pr-respond` but the skill requires VALID comments to go
  through `Dev10x:gh-pr-fixup` — using the raw API is a violation

If the command is a delegation bypass, treat it as a match and
output the reinforcement pointing to the correct sub-skill.

### Step 3: Fall back to SKILLS.md

If no direct mapping exists, read `~/.claude/SKILLS.md` and scan
skill descriptions from the system-reminder context to find the
best match based on the command's purpose.

### Step 4: Output reinforcement message

Output a firm, concise reinforcement message with these sections:

1. **Command detected:** — the CLI command that was identified
2. **Use instead:** — skill invocation name and one-line description
3. **Why:** — reason from the map entry (if available)
4. **How to invoke:** — `Skill("<skill-name>")` call syntax
5. **Related skills:** — from the map entry (if available)

If multiple skills could apply, list all of them ranked by
relevance.

### Step 4b: Respect user rejection

**If the user explicitly rejected the command** (denied the Bash
tool call), do NOT conclude "no violation found" and resume the
rejected workflow. A user rejection overrides documentation
matching — even if the command appears valid within the skill,
the user's denial takes precedence. Instead, ask the user what
they expected if no skill match is found.

### Step 5: Reinforce the general principle

End with a brief reminder:

> Always check if a skill or MCP tool exists before reaching for
> CLI commands. Skills provide consistent behavior, proper tool
> declarations, and avoid permission friction.

## Examples

### Example 1: kubectl usage

**User:** `/Dev10x:skill-reinforcement`
(after agent ran `kubectl get pods -n staging`)

**Output:**
```
## Skill Reinforcement

**Command detected:** `kubectl get pods -n staging`
**Use instead:** `/Dev10x:k8s` — Kubernetes operations via
aws-vault authenticated kubectl

**Why:** Direct kubectl calls bypass aws-vault authentication
and may fail or use wrong credentials.

**How to invoke:**
Skill("Dev10x:k8s")
```

### Example 2: direct git push

**User:** `/Dev10x:skill-reinforcement`
(after agent ran `git push origin feature-branch`)

**Output:**
```
## Skill Reinforcement

**Command detected:** `git push origin feature-branch`
**Use instead:** `/Dev10x:git` — Safe git push with
protected branch checks

**Why:** Direct git push bypasses force-push protection
on develop/main branches.

**How to invoke:**
Skill("Dev10x:git")
```

### Example 3: no match found

**User:** `/Dev10x:skill-reinforcement`
(after agent ran `curl https://api.example.com/health`)

**Output:**
```
## Skill Reinforcement

**Command detected:** `curl https://api.example.com/health`
**No direct skill match found.**

Available skills that might help:
- `/Dev10x:k8s` — if checking service health in k8s
- `/Dev10x:investigate` — if investigating a bug report

Check ~/.claude/SKILLS.md for the full list of available skills.
