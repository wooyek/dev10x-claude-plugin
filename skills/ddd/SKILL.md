description: >
  Run or continue a DDD Event Storming workshop to explore, model, and
  stress-test domain architecture. Use when the user mentions DDD,
  domain modeling, event storming, bounded contexts, domain events,
  aggregates, or wants to explore/scope a new feature area against an
  existing domain model. Also triggers on "workshop", "domain session",
  "stress test the architecture", "apply archetype", or "scope the domain".
  Use this skill even for tasks like "add tax support" or "what breaks if
  we add goods pricing" — those are domain exploration questions that need
  the workshop methodology. Always use this skill before ticket-scope
  when the feature area is new or crosses bounded context boundaries.

# DDD Event Storming Workshop

Guide users through structured domain exploration using DDD Event
Storming, Software Archetypes, and architecture stress testing.

## When to Use

**Trigger on:**
- Starting a new domain modeling session
- Continuing or refining an existing domain model
- Exploring a new feature area or extension
- Stress-testing the architecture against a future scenario
- Applying or recognizing Software Archetypes in the model
- Scoping a feature that crosses bounded context boundaries
- Resolving a contradiction found during implementation

**Do NOT use for:**
- Scoping a single well-defined ticket (use `ticket-scope` instead)
- Writing an ADR for an already-decided topic (use `write-adr` prompt)
- Pure implementation tasks with no domain questions

## Determine Session Type

Before starting, determine which mode applies:

| Mode | Trigger | Read before starting |
|---|---|---|
| **New workshop** | No `docs/domain/` exists yet | `references/document-structure.md` |
| **Continue workshop** | `docs/domain/model.md` exists | All existing domain docs (Step 1) |
| **Stress test** | "What if we add X?" / "Does Y break?" | `references/stress-test-protocol.md` |
| **Archetype application** | "This feels bloated" / "Apply archetype" | `references/archetypes-catalog.md` |

---

## Step 1: Load Context (Continue/Stress-Test modes)

Read these files **in this order** before proceeding:

1. `docs/domain/model.md` — current domain model
2. `docs/domain/decisions.md` — all prior decisions (append-only)
3. `docs/domain/calculator.md` — pricing pipeline and formulas
4. `docs/domain/stress-tests.md` — validated architectural seams
5. `docs/domain/glossary.md` — ubiquitous language
6. `docs/domain/epics.md` — tickets and priorities
7. Latest file in `docs/domain/workshops/` — previous session

Then read implementation state:
8. `apps/web/src/lib/domain/` — current TypeScript (if any)
9. `CLAUDE.md` — project conventions

**Summarize** what you understand in 3-5 sentences before proceeding.

For **new workshops**, skip to Step 2 and read
`references/document-structure.md` to scaffold the docs directory.

---

## Step 2: Process Rules

Read `references/process-rules.md` for the full set. Summary:

### Minimize interruptions

**Go as long as possible without asking questions.** Make reasonable
assumptions, note alternatives, store unresolved choices. Only stop
when the choice is genuinely arbitrary or high-stakes.

When you DO need input, **batch ALL questions into a single
structured decision menu** with options. Never one question at a
time.

### Protect accumulated decisions

**Never re-derive or silently override decisions from decisions.md.**
If new info contradicts a prior decision, propose a NEW decision
that explicitly supersedes it — state which, why, and what changes
downstream. Reference decisions by ID: `[D-NNN]`.

### Genericize proprietary data

Use reference materials (spreadsheets, specs) as behavioral models.
Replace proprietary specifics with generic examples. The domain
model must never leak client IP.

---

## Step 3: Exploration

Read `references/exploration-methodology.md` for DDD techniques.

### Event Storming Flow

1. **Identify domain events** — what happens in the system? (orange)
2. **Identify commands** — what triggers each event? (blue)
3. **Identify actors** — who issues each command? (yellow)
4. **Identify policies** — what rules fire after events? (lilac)
5. **Identify aggregates** — what data clusters together?
6. **Identify bounded contexts** — where are the seams?
7. **Identify value objects** — what are the typed quantities?

### Software Archetypes Recognition

Read `references/archetypes-catalog.md` for the full pattern table.

At every stage, check: **does this problem match a known archetype?**

| If you see... | Apply... |
|---|---|
| Flat config with N named fields | **Pricing** (composable pipeline) |
| Raw `number` for money or effort | **Quantity** (Money, Effort, Ratio) |
| Users, departments, vendors | **Party** (role-based) |
| "What resources does this need?" | **Availability** / assignment |
| Complex conditional logic | **Rules** (condition trees) |
| Items in a hierarchy | **Product** (composite tree) |
| "Is this available at time X?" | **Availability** (time-slotted) |
| Bloated entity with mixed semantics | Step back — which archetype decomposition? |

**Applying an archetype is NOT premature abstraction.** It's
recognizing that this problem has been solved before. The archetype
provides the vocabulary and structure; the domain provides the
specific rules. See `references/archetypes-catalog.md` for detailed
guidance on each.

### Design Philosophy

These principles govern all proposals:

**"Don't make me think" (Krug)** — Prefer implicit automatic
behavior (auto-grouping on child add) over manual workflows. But
never auto-delete or auto-restructure — creation can be magic,
destruction requires intent.

**Configuration vs. Estimation** — Keep pricing configuration
cleanly separated from the estimation workspace. Users change
rules without touching estimates, and vice versa.

**Foundation-ready, not prematurely built** — Bake hooks into the
foundation (like i18n) so future capabilities are data extensions,
not refactors. **Rule of thumb:** nullable field or open union now
at zero runtime cost vs. data migration later → do it now.
Actual code/abstractions not yet used → defer.

**Plan but defer server dependencies** — Features requiring servers
(short URLs, cloud accounts) are scoped and designed but not built
until the client-side foundation is solid.

---

## Step 4: Stress Testing

Before committing to any model change, validate it. Read
`references/stress-test-protocol.md` for the full protocol.

### Quick stress-test checklist

1. **Trace through every pipeline stage** — for each stage, state:
   ZERO changes / additive / breaking.
2. **Check the stable core** — verify components in
   `stress-tests.md` "Stable Core" section remain stable.
3. **Identify seams** — if the extension needs a hook that doesn't
   exist, assess: cost now vs. cost if deferred.
4. **Check against prior decisions** — conflicts with `decisions.md`?
5. **Endgame scale test** — does this work at airport scale?
   (10-year project, 5000 items, 50 departments, mixed product
   types, multi-currency, hierarchical policy)

---

## Step 5: Decision Capture

Every choice gets recorded. Read
`references/session-deliverables.md` for the full format.

### Decision format

```markdown
## D-NNN: [Short title]

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status:** Active | Superseded by D-MMM
- **Workshop:** NNN

**Decision:** [What was chosen]

**Alternatives considered:**
1. [Option A] — [why not]
2. [Option B] — [why not]

**Rationale:** [Why this choice]
```

To supersede: add new decision with `supersedes: D-NNN`, update
old entry's status to `Superseded by D-MMM`.

---

## Step 6: Produce Artifacts

Read `references/session-deliverables.md` for complete format and
`references/document-structure.md` for file responsibilities.

### Always produce

1. **New entries in `decisions.md`** — every choice, even "we
   decided not to do X"
2. **Workshop record** in `workshops/NNN-topic.md` — narrative,
   decisions list, model changes, open questions

### When applicable

3. Updated `model.md` (if types/pipeline/aggregates changed)
4. Updated `calculator.md` (if formulas/golden tests changed)
5. Updated `epics.md` (if tickets added/refined/completed)
6. New scenario in `stress-tests.md` (if stress test was run)
7. Updated `glossary.md` (if new terms introduced)
8. New Claude CLI prompts in `docs/prompts/` (if feature area
   is fully scoped and ready for implementation)

### Ticket format

Divide features into **configuration tickets** and **estimation
tickets**. Each ticket needs: JTBD Job Story, scope, acceptance
criteria, dependencies. See `epics.md` for established format.

---

## New Workshop: Scaffolding

When no `docs/domain/` exists, create the full structure. Read
`references/document-structure.md` for the complete specification.

```bash
mkdir -p docs/domain/workshops docs/prompts
```

Create these files from the templates in
`references/document-structure.md`:
- `docs/domain/README.md` — documentation architecture index
- `docs/domain/model.md` — domain model (initially empty scaffold)
- `docs/domain/decisions.md` — decision log (empty, with format guide)
- `docs/domain/calculator.md` — calculator spec (empty scaffold)
- `docs/domain/glossary.md` — ubiquitous language (empty table)
- `docs/domain/stress-tests.md` — stress tests (empty, with format)
- `docs/domain/epics.md` — epics and tickets (empty scaffold)
- `docs/domain/workshops/TEMPLATE.md` — workshop record template

Then proceed with exploration (Step 3).
