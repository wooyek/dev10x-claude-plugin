# Dev10x:scope — Base Technical Scoping

## Overview

Foundational scoping skill that provides reusable research and
architecture design workflows. Not directly invocable — extended by:

- `Dev10x:ticket-scope` — for scoping Linear tickets
- `Dev10x:adr` — for creating Architecture Decision Records

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.

**Auto-advance:** Complete each phase, immediately start the next.
Never pause between phases.

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** Execute these
`TaskCreate` calls at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Gather technical context", activeForm="Gathering context")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Design solution architecture", activeForm="Designing solution")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Create implementation plan", activeForm="Planning implementation")`
4. `TaskCreate(subject="Document architecture and decisions", activeForm="Documenting")`
5. `TaskCreate(subject="Validate against principles", activeForm="Validating design")`

Set sequential dependencies. Update status as each completes.

**Parallel research in Phase 1:** Dispatch Explore subagents for
independent research paths (external docs, codebase patterns,
test expectations) — collect results before moving to Phase 2.

**Decision gate after Phase 2:** Queue a decision for supervisor
review of the proposed architecture before creating the
implementation plan. If no other tasks are running, present
immediately.

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text, call spec: [ask-design-approval.md](./tool-calls/ask-design-approval.md)).
Options:
- Proceed to implementation plan (Recommended) — Design looks good, create actionable steps
- Revise design — I have corrections to the architecture
- More research needed — Need to explore additional patterns

## Core Scoping Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Understand the problem space before proposing solutions.

Dispatch parallel Explore subagents for independent research:

```
Agent(subagent_type="Explore",
    description="Research external documentation",
    prompt="Fetch and summarize relevant docs for [topic]. Return: key concepts, APIs, constraints.",
    run_in_background=true)
Agent(subagent_type="Explore",
    description="Find codebase patterns",
    prompt="Search for similar components in [repo]. Return: pattern names, file paths, signatures.",
    run_in_background=true)
```

Collect results, then proceed through sub-steps:

#### 1.1 Identify Starting Point

Determine what you're scoping:
- **External input** (URL, documentation, API docs)
- **Codebase exploration** (find patterns, understand current state)
- **Problem statement** (user-defined requirements)

#### 1.2 Research External Resources

If external documentation is relevant:

1. Fetch documentation using WebFetch
2. Extract key concepts, APIs, patterns
3. Note requirements, constraints, best practices
4. Identify integration points with existing code

#### 1.3 Explore Existing Codebase

Search for related patterns and implementations:

```bash
# Find similar patterns
Grep: "class.*Creator|Service|Handler"
Glob: "src/**/client/*.py"

# Read existing implementations
Read: Similar service files
Read: Related tests for behavior expectations
```

**Key questions:**
- What patterns exist for similar functionality?
- What components already exist that we can reuse?
- What naming conventions are used?
- How is dependency injection configured?

#### 1.4 Identify Components

Document what exists vs. what's needed:

| Category | Existing | New/Modified |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Repositories** | List existing | List new |
| **Services** | List existing | List new |
| **DTOs** | List existing | List new |
| **Models** | List existing | List new |
| **APIs** | List existing | List new |

Mark phase transition: `TaskUpdate(taskId=gather_task, status="completed")` then `TaskUpdate(taskId=design_task, status="in_progress")`

### Phase 2: Solution Design

**Goal:** Design architecture that follows existing patterns.

#### 2.1 Follow Existing Patterns

**CRITICAL:** Always follow established patterns in the codebase.

1. Search for similar components: `Grep "class.*Service"`
2. Read the pattern: Read existing service file
3. Extract the structure (e.g., Entry Point → Service → Client)
4. Apply to new component with same layering

#### 2.2 Apply Design Principles

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**
- Don't return data that won't be used
- Prefer void methods over rich return types unless needed
- Remove unused fields from responses

**SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):**
- Each component has one job
- Entry point loads/validates, service orchestrates, client
  calls external API

**Clean Architecture:**
- Keep frameworks at edges
- Business logic independent of infrastructure
- Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions)

#### 2.3 Design Components

For each new component, define:

```
Component: [Name]
Location: [File path]
Responsibility: [Single sentence]
Pattern: [Reference to existing pattern]
Signature: [Method signatures with types]
Dependencies: [What it needs injected]
```

After design, queue the approval decision (see Orchestration
section above). Auto-advance to Phase 3 after approval.

Mark phase transition: `TaskUpdate(taskId=design_task, status="completed")` then `TaskUpdate(taskId=plan_task, status="in_progress")`

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

**Goal:** Create actionable implementation steps.

#### 3.1 Order Steps Logically

Consider dependencies between steps:
1. Types/DTOs first (no dependencies)
2. Client layer (depends on types)
3. Service layer (depends on client)
4. Entry point (depends on service)
5. Tests (depends on implementation)

#### 3.2 Include Code References

Each step should include:
- **File path:** Where to make changes
- **Pattern reference:** Link to similar existing code
- **Code example:** Skeleton or key signatures

#### 3.3 Identify Risks

**Technical Risks:**
- Breaking changes
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Data integrity

**Mitigation strategies** for each risk.

Mark phase transition: `TaskUpdate(taskId=plan_task, status="completed")` then `TaskUpdate(taskId=doc_task, status="in_progress")`

### Phase 4: Documentation

**Goal:** Create clear, actionable documentation.

#### 4.1 Document Architecture

Create diagrams when helpful:
- Component diagrams (what talks to what)
- Sequence diagrams (flow of operations)
- Data flow diagrams (how data moves)

**PlantUML for diagrams** (bundled with this skill):
```bash
java -jar skills/scope/bin/plantuml.jar diagram.puml
```

#### 4.2 Document Decisions

For significant decisions, document:
- **Context:** Why we needed to decide
- **Decision:** What we chose
- **Consequences:** What becomes easier/harder
- **Alternatives:** What we considered and rejected

Mark phase transition: `TaskUpdate(taskId=doc_task, status="completed")` then `TaskUpdate(taskId=validate_task, status="in_progress")`

### Phase 5: Review and Iterate

**Goal:** Refine based on feedback.

#### 5.1 User Feedback Loop

Present findings to user and incorporate corrections:
- Architecture adjustments
- Pattern corrections
- Business context additions
- YAGNI simplifications

#### 5.2 Validate Against Principles

Before finalizing, check:
- [ ] Follows existing codebase patterns?
- [ ] YAGNI applied (no unused features)?
- [ ] SRP maintained (single responsibility)?
- [ ] Clean Architecture respected?
- [ ] Dependencies properly ordered?
- [ ] Risks identified and mitigated?

## Key Learnings from Practice

### Pattern Following is Critical

When designing new components, find and follow existing patterns:

1. Search for similar components: `Grep "class.*Service"`
2. Read the pattern: Read existing service file
3. Extract the structure: Entry Point → Service → Client
4. Apply to new component with same layering

### User Corrections Are Valuable

User corrections reveal:
- Business context not visible in code
- Organizational preferences
- Future plans affecting design
- Domain knowledge gaps

Always incorporate corrections and update documentation.

### YAGNI Reduces Complexity

When unsure if a feature is needed:
- Start without it
- Add when actually needed
- Remove unused code

### Diagrams Aid Understanding

Visual diagrams help communicate:
- Component relationships
- Data flow
- Sequence of operations

Use PlantUML for consistent, version-controlled diagrams.
