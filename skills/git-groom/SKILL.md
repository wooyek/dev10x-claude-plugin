# Git Branch History Grooming

## Overview

This skill helps restructure, polish, and clean up git commit history in the current branch before merging. Use it to create atomic, well-organized commits that tell a clear story.

**Guiding Principle:** When rewriting commit titles, shift the perspective from what changed in the code to what it enables for the user. Describe the user-facing outcome, not the implementation detail. E.g., `Enable automatic terminal discovery` not `Add DEVICES_READ to Square OAuth scopes`.

**When to use this skill:**
- After receiving review feedback that requires changes across multiple commits
- When commits have become messy during development
- Before creating a PR to ensure clean history
- When CI blocks merge due to fixup commits

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.
Read that file for full context on auto-advance and batched
decision queues.

**Auto-advance:** Complete each phase and immediately start the
next. Never pause between phases to ask "should I continue?".

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** Execute these
`TaskCreate` calls at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Analyze commit history", activeForm="Analyzing commits")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Choose restructuring strategy", activeForm="Choosing strategy")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Execute restructure", activeForm="Restructuring commits")`
4. `TaskCreate(subject="Push and update PR references", activeForm="Pushing changes")`

Set dependencies: strategy blocked by analysis, execute blocked
by strategy, push blocked by execute.

**Nested-mode exemption:** When invoked as a nested skill within
a parent orchestrator (e.g., via `Skill()` from `Dev10x:work-on`),
startup task creation is optional — at most 1 summary task. See
`references/task-orchestration.md` § Delegated Invocation Exception.

**Scope of nested-mode exemption:** The exemption covers only
`TaskCreate` calls (task tracking overhead). It does NOT exempt
`REQUIRED: AskUserQuestion` decision gates — the Phase 2
strategy selection gate must still fire even in nested mode,
because the parent cannot predict which grooming strategy is
appropriate. The parent's "Full shipping pipeline" selection
establishes *intent to groom*, not *which strategy to use*.

**NEVER auto-select a grooming strategy.** Even when invoked
from a parent orchestrator that has chosen "Full shipping
pipeline", you MUST present the `AskUserQuestion` gate for
strategy selection. Auto-selecting autosquash because it is
"Recommended" is a gate bypass — the recommendation is a
default hint for the user, not permission to skip the gate.
Anti-pattern (GH-458): agent ran `git autosquash-develop`
without presenting the strategy gate in nested mode.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Analyze Current State

```bash
# View commits in current branch (relative to base)
git log --oneline develop..HEAD

# See what files changed in each commit
git log --oneline --stat develop..HEAD

# Identify the base commit for rebasing
git merge-base develop HEAD
```

**SHA Staleness Warning:** Record SHAs at analysis time only for planning.
Before writing any execution scripts (message files, sequence editor),
always re-run `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` to get the current SHAs.
Any commit (rebase, amend, reset) changes all descendant SHAs. Using
analysis-time SHAs in execution scripts will silently target wrong commits.

### Phase 2: Choose Strategy

After analysis, queue the strategy decision in task metadata.
If no other tasks are running, present immediately. Otherwise
the orchestrator batches it with other pending decisions.

Mark the phase transition: `TaskUpdate(taskId=strategy_task, status="pending", metadata={"decision_needed": "Which restructuring strategy?", "options": ["Fixup", "Full restructure", "Mass rewrite", "Interactive rebase"]})`

**At strict/guided level:**

**REQUIRED: Call `AskUserQuestion`** (do NOT use plain text, call spec: [ask-restructuring-strategy.md](./tool-calls/ask-restructuring-strategy.md)).
Options:
- Fixup (Recommended) — Small targeted fixes to specific commits
- Full restructure — Reset all commits, rebuild from scratch
- Mass rewrite — Non-interactive message rewrite from JSON
- Interactive rebase — Full manual control over commit order

**At adaptive level (GH-530):**

Auto-select strategy based on commit analysis:
- Only fixup commits present → auto-select "Fixup"
- No fixups, only message issues → auto-select "Mass rewrite"
- Mixed structural issues → auto-select "Fixup" (safest default)
- No `AskUserQuestion` call — execution continues uninterrupted

See `references/friction-levels.md` for the universal model.

After selection, update the execute task description with the
chosen strategy and auto-advance into Phase 3.

### Phase 3 Precondition: Stash Guard

Before any rebase operation, check for unstaged changes that
would cause `git rebase` to fail:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If unstaged changes exist (e.g., lock files, generated files):
1. Stash them: `git stash --include-untracked`
2. Run the rebase strategy
3. Pop the stash: `git stash pop`

This prevents the common failure: `error: cannot rebase: You
have unstaged changes.` — which halts the entire groom pipeline.

#### Strategy A: Fixup Commits (for small targeted changes)

Use when making small fixes to specific commits:

```bash
# Create a fixup commit targeting a specific commit
git add <files>
git commit --fixup=<target-commit-sha>

# Simple autosquash (fixup commits only, no reordering):
git autosquash-develop

# Custom sequence (reordering, message rewrites, splits):
# 1. Create unique seq file: /tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh git rebase-seq .txt
# 2. Write sequence to the returned path
# 3. Run: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-rebase-groom.sh <path> develop
```

**Key insight:** For pure autosquash (squashing fixup commits into their targets), use `git autosquash-develop` — an alias that wraps `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash $(git merge-base develop HEAD)` internally, avoiding env-prefix and subshell permission friction. The rebase script (`git-rebase-groom.sh`) replaces the todo with your sequence file, so commits not listed in the file are dropped. Only use the script when you need custom sequence control.

#### Strategy B: Full Restructure (for major reorganization)

Use when commits need complete reorganization:

```bash
# Soft reset to base, keeping all changes staged
git reset --soft <base-commit>

# Now selectively create new atomic commits
git reset HEAD  # Unstage everything
git add -p      # Interactively stage hunks
git commit -m "First logical change"
# Repeat for each logical unit
```

#### Strategy D: Non-Interactive Mass Rewrite (for bulk message updates)

Use when rewriting many commit messages without structural changes (no
splits, squashes, or file renames beyond what the commits already have).
Fully automatable — no interactive editor required.

**Use the script** (single permission approval, runs unattended):
```bash
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh git groom-config .json
```
Write the config to the returned path, then run:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-groom/scripts/mass-rewrite.py <config-path>
```
The script creates its own isolated workdir under `/tmp/claude/git/`.

Config format:
```json
{
  "base": "develop",
  "commits": {
    "abc1234": "New outcome-focused message",
    "def5678": {
      "message": "New message with file renames",
      "renames": [["old/path/file.md", "new/path/file.md"]]
    }
  }
}
```

The script validates SHAs against the current log before doing anything,
prints a preview of all commits (marking which will be rewritten), then
runs the full rebase unattended. See the script docstring for details.

**Manual steps (reference / fallback):** The script implements the
following steps — useful to understand internals or when the script
cannot be used.

**Step 1:** Re-check current SHAs (never use analysis-time SHAs):
```bash
git log --oneline $(git merge-base develop HEAD)..HEAD
```

**Step 2:** Create an isolated workdir for this groom session:
```bash
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh -d git groom
```
Store the returned path as `$WORKDIR`.

**Step 3:** Write one message file per commit to rewrite using the Write tool:

```
Write $WORKDIR/msgs/<7-char-sha>:
Enable user login with HMAC session auth
```

Repeat for each commit needing a new message. The Write tool creates
parent directories as needed.

**Step 4:** Write the complete rebase sequence using the Write tool:

```bash
/tmp/claude/bin/mktmp.sh git rebase-seq .txt
```

Write to the returned path:
```
pick <oldest-sha> First commit
exec git commit --amend -F $WORKDIR/msgs/<oldest-sha-short>
pick <sha> Second commit with git mv
exec git mv old/path new/path && git commit --amend -F $WORKDIR/msgs/<sha-short>
pick <newest-sha> Third commit (no rewrite needed)
```

Oldest commit at top.

**Step 5:** Run the non-interactive rebase:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-rebase-groom.sh <seq-path> develop
```

`GIT_EDITOR="true"` suppresses the commit message editor for `--amend`
so the rebase runs fully unattended.

#### Strategy C: Interactive Rebase (for reordering/editing)

Use when you need to reorder, edit messages, or split commits:

```bash
git rebase -i <base-commit>
```

Commands in interactive rebase:
- `pick` - keep commit as-is
- `reword` - change commit message
- `edit` - stop to amend the commit
- `squash` - meld into previous commit (keep message)
- `fixup` - meld into previous commit (discard message)
- `drop` - remove commit

### Conflict Resolution During Rebase

When any rebase strategy encounters conflicts, resolve them
inline before falling back to abort + Strategy B:

1. Run `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` to list conflicted files
2. For each conflicted file:
   a. Read the file with the Read tool
   b. Identify conflict markers and determine the correct resolution
   c. Edit the file to remove markers and apply the resolution
   d. Stage: `git add <file>`
3. Continue: `git rebase --continue`
4. If conflicts recur, repeat (max 3 rounds)
5. If resolution fails after 3 rounds or conflicts are too complex,
   abort and fall back to Strategy B (soft reset)

**MCP tool callers:** When `rebase_groom` or `mass_rewrite` returns
`{"conflict": true}`, the rebase is paused — not aborted. Use the
`conflicted_files` list to resolve, then run `git rebase --continue`
via Bash. Do NOT call `git rebase --abort` unless resolution fails.

### Phase 3: Push Changes

Mark phase transition: `TaskUpdate(taskId=execute_task, status="completed")` then `TaskUpdate(taskId=push_task, status="in_progress")`

```bash
# Force push with lease (safer than --force)
git push origin <branch> --force-with-lease
```

**Important:** `--force-with-lease` fails if someone else pushed to the branch, preventing accidental overwrites.

**CI invalidation warning:** Force push triggers new CI runs on
the new HEAD. All previous CI results become invalid. The calling
skill (e.g., `Dev10x:work-on`) MUST re-monitor CI after grooming
completes — do not declare CI green based on pre-groom results.

### Phase 4: Update PR References

After force-pushing groomed history, PR body and summary comment may
contain stale commit hashes.

1. Get the new commit hash(es): `git log --oneline develop..HEAD`
2. Update the PR body commit links with new hashes
3. Update the summary comment (first comment by the author) with new hashes
4. If the PR body has a Job Story, preserve it unchanged

This step is only needed when an open PR exists for the branch.

After completing, mark all tasks done: `TaskUpdate(taskId=push_task, status="completed")`

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Review Comments Need Fixes

```bash
# Make the fix
vim file.py

# Create fixup targeting the original commit
git add file.py
git commit --fixup=$(git log --oneline | grep "original message" | cut -d' ' -f1)

# Squash before pushing
git rebase -i --autosquash $(git merge-base develop HEAD)

# Push
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Scenario 2: CI Blocks Fixup Commits

Many repos have CI checks that block merging if fixup commits exist:

```bash
# Squash all fixup commits
git rebase -i --autosquash $(git merge-base develop HEAD)

# The editor opens with fixup commits already positioned - just save and exit
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Scenario 3: Split One Commit Into Two

```bash
git rebase -i <base>
# Mark the commit as 'edit'
# When rebase stops:
git reset HEAD^           # Undo the commit, keep changes
git add -p                # Stage first logical change
git commit -m "First part"
git add .                 # Stage remaining changes
git commit -m "Second part"
git rebase --continue
```

### Scenario 4: Combine Multiple Commits

```bash
git rebase -i <base>
# Keep first commit as 'pick'
# Change subsequent commits to 'squash' or 'fixup'
# Save and edit the combined commit message
```

## Best Practices

1. **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
2. **Meaningful messages**: Follow project conventions (gitmoji, ticket refs, etc.)
3. **Test before pushing**: Ensure each commit in history passes CI individually
4. **Communicate**: If others are working on the branch, coordinate before force pushing
5. **Backup first**: Create a backup branch before complex rewrites:
   ```bash
   git branch backup-before-rewrite
   ```

## Commit Message Conventions

Follow project standards. Common patterns:
- Gitmoji: `PAY-123 Add new feature`
- Conventional: `feat(payments): add new feature [PAY-123]`

Limit title to 72 characters. Add body for complex changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Rebase Conflicts

When a rebase hits merge conflicts, the groom skill is responsible
for resolving them rather than aborting and asking the user.

**Detection:** Scripts output `CONFLICT_DETECTED` with structured
info (conflicted files, rebase HEAD). MCP tools return
`{"conflict": true, "conflicted_files": [...]}`.

**Resolution loop:**

1. Read each conflicted file with the Read tool
2. Examine the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Resolve by choosing the correct version or merging both sides
4. Write the resolved file with the Edit tool (remove all markers)
5. Stage resolved files: `git add <file>`
6. Continue: `git rebase --continue`
7. If new conflicts arise, repeat from step 1

**When to abort instead of resolving:**
- Conflicts span 5+ files with complex semantic changes
- The conflict indicates a fundamental structural divergence
  that requires the user's domain knowledge to resolve
- After 3 resolution rounds with recurring conflicts

In abort cases, run `git rebase --abort` and fall back to
Strategy B (soft reset) as documented below.

```bash
git rebase --abort
git reset --soft $(git merge-base develop HEAD)
git reset HEAD
# Recommit in clean atomic chunks
```

### Autosquash Fails on Cross-Commit Fixups

When a fixup commit modifies files that span multiple original commits
(e.g., service layer in commit A and mutation layer in commit B),
`--autosquash` places the fixup after one target but before the other.
This causes conflicts because the later commit's files don't exist yet
at that point in history.

**Symptom:** Rebase conflict immediately after autosquash reorders commits.

**Fix:** Abort and use Strategy B (soft reset) instead:

```bash
git rebase --abort
git reset --soft $(git merge-base develop HEAD)
git reset HEAD
# Recommit in clean atomic chunks
```

*Why?* Example: a fixup touching both `service.py` (commit 1)
and `mutations.py` (commit 3) failed autosquash. Strategy B resolved
it in one pass.

### exec Steps Leaving Staged Changes Halt Rebase

When using `exec` lines in an interactive rebase todo, each `exec` command
runs in the repo's working tree with the index from the previous step.
If an `exec git mv` stages a rename but does not commit it, the next
`exec` command (or the next `pick`) finds the index dirty and rebase halts:

```
error: cannot rebase: Your index contains uncommitted changes.
```

**Symptom:** Rebase stops mid-run on a commit that involves `git mv`.

**Fix:** Chain all operations for a single commit into **one `exec` line**
using `&&` so the index is clean before the next `pick`:

```
exec git mv old/path/A new/path/A && git mv old/path/B new/path/B && git commit --amend -F $WORKDIR/msgs/<sha>
```

Never use separate `exec git mv` lines for the same commit amendment.

### GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR file must be oldest-first

`git rebase -i` expects commits listed **oldest at the top, newest at the
bottom** — the opposite of `git log` default output (newest first).

**Symptom:** Immediate modify/delete conflict on files added in later commits
(e.g., `package.json deleted in HEAD and modified in <sha>`).

**Fix:** Reverse `git log` order when building the sequence file:

```bash
git log --oneline <base>..HEAD | tac  # tac reverses line order
```

Verify: the **first line** of the sequence file must be the **oldest** commit SHA.

### Stale SHAs in multi-pass rebases

After each rebase pass all commit SHAs change. A sequence file written before
pass 1 contains stale SHAs that will silently pick the wrong commits in pass 2.

**Symptom:** A commit gets the wrong message (e.g., Makefile commit gets the
Docker commit's name because the stale SHA pointed elsewhere).

**Fix:** Always run `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` after each rebase pass
and use the fresh SHAs when writing the next sequence file.

### git-rebase-groom.sh Drops Commits on Autosquash

`git-rebase-groom.sh` uses a custom `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` that
replaces the rebase todo with the contents of
`$GROOM_SEQ_FILE`. If the sequence file
doesn't list ALL commits, the missing ones are dropped.

**Symptom:** After running `git-rebase-groom.sh`, only a subset
of commits remain in history.

**Fix:** For simple autosquash (no custom reordering), skip the
script entirely:

```bash
git autosquash-develop
```

Use `git-rebase-groom.sh` only when you need custom sequence
control (message rewrites, splits, reordering).

### Files Excluded by Global ~/.gitignore in Soft Reset

When using Strategy B (soft reset + recommit), files tracked in the
original branch may be ignored by the user's global `~/.gitignore`
(e.g. `.nvmrc`, `.DS_Store`). `git add <file>` silently skips them,
causing the commit to be incomplete.

**Symptom:** Script exits with error mid-run; a commit is missing
expected files that appear in the backup but not in the new history.

**Diagnose:**
```bash
git check-ignore -v <file>   # shows which gitignore rule is blocking
```

**Fix:** Use `git add -f` to force-add the file:
```bash
git add -f apps/web/.nvmrc
```

Add the `-f` flag to every `git add` call in the recommit script
for files that are in the global gitignore.

### `$()` Subshells Cause Permission Friction

When calling skill scripts, never wrap arguments in `$()` subshells:

```bash
# BAD — $() changes the effective command prefix, breaking allow rules
BASE=$(git merge-base develop HEAD)
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-rebase-groom.sh "$BASE"

# GOOD — pass branch name directly, script resolves merge-base internally
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git/scripts/git-rebase-groom.sh develop
```

**Symptom:** Every invocation prompts for permission even though the
script path matches an existing `Bash(~/.claude/skills:*)` allow rule.

**Why?** `settings.local.json` allow rules match the command prefix.
`BASE=$(git merge-base develop HEAD) && script` has prefix `BASE=...`,
not `~/.claude/skills/...`. Even a standalone `git merge-base` before
the script is unnecessary friction — the script accepts branch names.

*Source:* Prior sessions: 3 consecutive user corrections to eliminate
`$()` from the grooming workflow.

### Recover from Bad Rewrite

```bash
# Find the previous HEAD position
git reflog

# Reset to before the rewrite
git reset --hard HEAD@{n}
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### Dev10x:git-commit-split

When the user asks to split a specific commit mid-session (e.g. "Split
<sha>"), invoke the `Dev10x:git-commit-split` skill rather than handling it inline.
`Dev10x:git-commit-split` provides the canonical workflow with dependency-order
guidance and commit message conventions.

```
User: "Split 835fc34"
-> Invoke Skill(Dev10x:git-commit-split) before proceeding
```

## Integration with PR Workflow

1. Create fixup commits as you address review comments
2. Reply to each comment with "Fixed in commit <sha>"
3. Before final push, squash all fixups: `git rebase -i --autosquash`
4. Force push to trigger fresh CI run
5. CI should now pass (no fixup commits blocking merge)
