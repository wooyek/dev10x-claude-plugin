# Dev10x:onboarding — Guided Discovery

Interactive walkthrough introducing Dev10x in under 10 minutes.
Detects existing configuration and skips already-done steps.

## Orchestration

**REQUIRED: Create tasks before ANY work.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Detect user context", activeForm="Detecting context")`
2. `TaskCreate(subject="Guided tour", activeForm="Walking through capabilities")`
3. `TaskCreate(subject="Setup assistance", activeForm="Setting up")`

## Execution

Read and follow the tour guide:

```
Read(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/onboarding/references/tour-guide.md)
```

Execute each phase in order. Skip phases/sections based on
configuration detection results. Use `AskUserQuestion` at
every decision gate marked REQUIRED in the guide.
