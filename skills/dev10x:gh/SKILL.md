# dev10x:gh — GitHub CLI helpers

Shell script wrappers for common `gh` operations. Pre-approved via
`allowed-tools` so they run without permission prompts.

## Critical Rule: Never derive BRANCH from local git

**WRONG** — `git branch --show-current` returns the CURRENT WORKTREE's
branch, which is a DIFFERENT PR when using multiple worktrees:

```bash
# ❌ Will give the wrong branch in a multi-worktree setup
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

**RIGHT** — always fetch the PR's branch from GitHub:

```bash
# ✅ Always correct regardless of which worktree you're in
BRANCH=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --json headRefName -q '.headRefName')
```

## gh-pr-detect.sh

Detects PR number, repo, URL, and branch. Accepts a GitHub PR URL, a
bare PR number, or nothing (detects from current branch).

```bash
~/.claude/skills/dev10x:gh/scripts/gh-pr-detect.sh "$ARG"
```

| Input | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123` | Parses number and repo from URL |
| `123` | Uses number; detects repo from cwd via `gh repo view` |
| *(none)* | Detects PR number from current branch via `gh pr view` |

Output (KEY=VALUE lines, one per line):

```
PR_NUMBER=123
REPO=your-org/your-repo
PR_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/123
BRANCH=user/TICKET-123/feature-description
```

Exits non-zero with an error message to stderr if detection fails.

### How to consume the output

Run the script directly. Claude parses the KEY=VALUE stdout and uses
the values in subsequent Bash calls. **Do not** use `source <(...)` —
it triggers process substitution permission prompts and breaks
allow-rule prefix matching.

```bash
# ✅ Run directly — script path is first token, matches allow rules
~/.claude/skills/dev10x:gh/scripts/gh-pr-detect.sh "$ARG"
# Parse PR_NUMBER, REPO, PR_URL, BRANCH from stdout

# ❌ NEVER use source <() — breaks allow rules, triggers permission prompt
source <(~/.claude/skills/dev10x:gh/scripts/gh-pr-detect.sh "$ARG")
```

When a single Bash call needs the variables (e.g., chaining with
another command), use the temp-file pattern:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/dev10x:gh/scripts/gh-pr-detect.sh "$ARG" > /tmp/claude/pr-detect.env && source /tmp/claude/pr-detect.env && echo "PR #$PR_NUMBER"
```

This keeps the script path as the first token so allow rules match.

## detect-tracker.sh

Detects issue tracker type from a ticket ID using prefix heuristics
and GitHub autolink references.

```bash
~/.claude/skills/dev10x:gh/scripts/detect-tracker.sh TICKET_ID
```

Detection cascade:

| Step | Condition | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GH-` prefix | `TRACKER=github`, builds `FIXES_URL` from current repo |
| 2 | Prefix matches a GitHub autolink with `linear.app` URL | `TRACKER=linear` |
| 3 | Prefix matches a GitHub autolink with `atlassian.net` URL | `TRACKER=jira` |
| 4 | No match | `TRACKER=unknown`, `FIXES_URL` empty |

Output (KEY=VALUE lines, same convention as `gh-pr-detect.sh`):

```
TRACKER=github
TICKET_ID=GH-15
TICKET_NUMBER=15
FIXES_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues/15
```

Consume the output the same way as `gh-pr-detect.sh` — run directly
and parse KEY=VALUE stdout. Do not use `source <(...)`.

## gh-issue-get.sh

Fetches a GitHub issue as JSON with full details.

```bash
~/.claude/skills/dev10x:gh/scripts/gh-issue-get.sh NUMBER [REPO]
```

| Param | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NUMBER` | yes | — |
| `REPO` | no | current repo via `gh repo view` |

Output: JSON object with fields `number`, `title`, `body`, `state`,
`labels`, `assignees`, `comments`.

## gh-issue-comments.sh

Returns comments on a GitHub issue as a JSON array.

```bash
~/.claude/skills/dev10x:gh/scripts/gh-issue-comments.sh NUMBER [REPO]
```

| Param | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NUMBER` | yes | — |
| `REPO` | no | current repo via `gh repo view` |

Output: JSON array of comment objects with `author`, `body`,
`createdAt`.
