## Example

```
✅ PAY-310 Fix flaky tests with non-zero tax amounts

Tests in TestAddTireServiceIndividual and TestAddTireServiceMultiple
were marked as flaky because they randomly failed when tax amounts
or percentages were generated as zero by Faker.

Solution:
- Added non_zero trait to MoneyFaker with min_value=Decimal('0.01')
- Updated test fixtures to ensure tax amounts and percentages >= 0.01
- Removed @pytest.mark.flaky decorators

Fixes: PAY-310
