  Request PR review — assigns GitHub reviewers and posts Slack
  notification in one command. Delegates to Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review
  and Dev10x:slack-review-request.
  TRIGGER when: PR is ready for review and needs both GitHub reviewer
  assignment and Slack notification.
  DO NOT TRIGGER when: PR is draft/WIP, or only need GitHub assignment
  without Slack (use Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review directly).

## Orchestration

This skill follows `references/task-orchestration.md` patterns.

**REQUIRED: Create a task at invocation.** Execute at startup:

1. `TaskCreate(subject="Request PR review", activeForm="Requesting review")`

Mark completed when done: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")`

**Auto-advance:** Complete each step, immediately start the next.

## Flow

### Step 1: Detect PR context

Use the `Dev10x:gh-context` script to detect PR number and repo:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gh-context/scripts/gh-pr-detect.sh "$ARG"
```

Parse `PR_NUMBER`, `REPO`, `PR_URL` from KEY=VALUE stdout.
Pass `$ARG` as the skill argument (PR URL, bare number, or empty).

If detection fails, report the error and stop.

### Step 2: Assign GitHub reviewers

Delegate to the GitHub reviewer assignment skill:

```
Skill("Dev10x:gh-pr-request-review", args="--pr {PR_NUMBER} --repo {REPO}")
```

This skill reads `~/.claude/memory/github-reviewers-config.yaml`,
resolves reviewers, and assigns them via GitHub API. It may skip
if the project is configured with `skip: true`.

Capture the outcome (assigned / skipped / error) for the summary.

### Step 3: Post Slack review notification

Delegate to the Slack notification skill:

```
Skill("Dev10x:slack-review-request", args="--pr {PR_NUMBER} --repo {REPO}")
```

This skill reads `~/.claude/memory/slack-config-code-review-requests.yaml`,
formats the message, asks for user confirmation, and posts to Slack.
It may skip if the project is configured with `skip: true`.

Capture the outcome (posted / skipped / error) for the summary.

### Step 4: Report summary

Report the combined result:

```
Review request for PR #{PR_NUMBER}:
- GitHub reviewers: {assigned / skipped / error}
- Slack notification: {posted / skipped / error}
```

## Notes

- Steps 2 and 3 are independent — if one skips, the other still runs
- Both skipping is valid (project may be configured to skip both)
- Each sub-skill uses its own config file — no combined config needed
- This skill is invoked by `Dev10x:gh-pr-monitor` Phase 3 and
  directly by users via `/Dev10x:request-review`
