# Validation Patterns for PR Comment Triage

This reference catalogs common patterns where a PR review comment can be
validated against the codebase without making code changes.

## Pattern: Inherited Field

**Detection:** Reviewer claims a field, method, or property is missing from a
class.

**Investigation:**
1. Read the file at the commented line
2. Find the class definition
3. Check `class Foo(Base, Mixin):` — trace each parent
4. Read each parent class, check for the claimed missing member
5. If found in any ancestor → **INVALID**

**Evidence reply template:**
```
The `{member}` {field/method} is inherited from `{ParentClass}`
defined in `{file_path}:{line}`:

    class {ParentClass}:
        {member} = ...
```

## Pattern: Existing Convention

**Detection:** Reviewer suggests using pattern X instead of Y ("should use
`select_related` instead of `prefetch_related`", "use `NewType` not `str`").

**Investigation:**
1. Grep codebase for pattern X: `rg "pattern_x" --type py -c`
2. Grep codebase for pattern Y: `rg "pattern_y" --type py -c`
3. Compare occurrence counts
4. Check if Y is the established convention in this bounded context
5. If Y is dominant or matches local convention → **INVALID**
6. If X is clearly dominant → **VALID**
7. If close or context-dependent → **QUESTION** (explain both usages)

**Evidence reply template:**
```
The codebase uses `{pattern_y}` as the established convention in this
context ({count_y} occurrences vs {count_x} for `{pattern_x}`):

{file_1}: {usage}
{file_2}: {usage}
...
```

## Pattern: Already Present

**Detection:** Reviewer claims something is missing that actually exists —
type annotation, test, docstring, import, parameter.

**Investigation:**
1. Read the exact file + line range mentioned in the comment
2. Check surrounding context (may be on adjacent line)
3. If the claimed missing thing is present → **INVALID**

**Evidence reply template:**
```
The {thing} is already present at `{file_path}:{line}`:

    {code_snippet}
```

## Pattern: Established Sibling

**Detection:** Reviewer suggests changing a method signature, return type, or
pattern that has sibling implementations following the same convention.

**Investigation:**
1. Identify the interface/protocol/base class
2. Find all implementations (grep for class name or method name)
3. List each sibling's signature
4. If current code matches siblings → **INVALID**
5. If current code diverges from siblings → **VALID**

**Evidence reply template:**
```
The current signature matches the established pattern across
sibling implementations:

- `{Sibling1}.{method}({params}) -> {return}`  ({file_1})
- `{Sibling2}.{method}({params}) -> {return}`  ({file_2})
- `{Current}.{method}({params}) -> {return}`    ({file_3})  ← this PR
```

## Pattern: Previously Addressed

**Detection:** Same concern was already raised in another thread on this PR,
and was either addressed with a fixup commit or explained.

**Investigation:**
1. Fetch all PR threads
2. Search for similar keywords in other thread bodies
3. Check if those threads have fixup commit replies
4. If addressed → **INVALID** with link to the other thread

**Evidence reply template:**
```
This was addressed in {thread_url} with commit `{hash}`.
```

## Pattern: Out of Scope

**Detection:** Comment is valid but addresses something beyond the PR's scope
— pre-existing issue, future work, different bounded context.

**Signals:**
- "Also consider..." / "Might want to..."
- Suggestion touches files not modified in this PR
- Concern about pre-existing behavior, not new code
- Enhancement request beyond the ticket scope

**Investigation:**
1. Check if the concern relates to code changed in this PR
2. If it's about untouched code → **OUT_OF_SCOPE**
3. If it's a valid enhancement beyond ticket scope → **OUT_OF_SCOPE**

**Reply template:**
```
Out of scope for this PR. {optional: "Tracked in TICKET-ID" or
"Good idea for a follow-up."}
```

## Pattern: Intentional Design

**Detection:** Reviewer questions a design choice that was deliberate —
"Why use X instead of Y?", "This seems inconsistent with Z."

**Investigation:**
1. Read surrounding code for context
2. Check if there's an ADR or comment explaining the choice
3. Check if X and Y serve different purposes in this context
4. If intentional → **QUESTION** (explain the reasoning)

**Reply template:**
```
This is intentional. {Explanation of why X was chosen over Y, with
technical justification.}
```

## Adding New Patterns

When you encounter a validation scenario not covered above:

1. Name the pattern (2-3 words)
2. Document the detection signal
3. List the investigation steps
4. Write an evidence reply template
5. Add it to this file

Keep patterns focused — each should cover one specific type of false positive.
