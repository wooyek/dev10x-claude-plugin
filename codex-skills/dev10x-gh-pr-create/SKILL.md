# Create Pull Request for Ticket

## Overview

This skill automates the creation of a GitHub pull request for the
current branch with issue tracker integration (GitHub Issues, Linear,
or JIRA). It handles pushing the branch, creating the PR with
appropriate title and body, adding checklist comments, and opening the
PR in your browser.

## Scripts

All multi-line commands live in `$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-pr-create/scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `verify-state.sh` | Validate branch, commits, and base branch ancestry |
| `generate-commit-list.sh` | Generate linked commit list for PR body |
| `pre-pr-checks.sh` | Run ruff, black, mypy, pytest before push |
| `create-pr.sh` | Push branch, create draft PR with body including checklist |
| `post-summary-comment.sh` | _(deprecated — checklist is now in PR body)_ |

## Prerequisites Check

**IMPORTANT:** Before executing this workflow, verify required tools:

1. Check if `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```
   If not authenticated, inform the user to run `gh auth login`

2. Verify we're in a git repository with a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote get-url origin
   ```

3. **Worktree check** — `verify-state.sh` reads git state from the current working
   directory. If the session is rooted in the main repo but the branch lives in a
   worktree, run it with `GIT_DIR` pointing to the worktree — BUT that env var
   prefix breaks `Bash($HOME/.codex/skills:*)` allow-rule matching. Instead, pass
   the worktree path as an argument when the script supports it, or use a subshell:
   ```bash
   # When invoking from main repo for a branch checked out in a worktree:
   # ❌  GIT_DIR=... verify-state.sh   (env prefix breaks allow rules)
   # ✅  Run the script from within the worktree context
   # Note: env var prefix is still subject to permission friction. The
   # cleanest alternative is to invoke pr:create while CWD is inside the
   # worktree, not the main repo.
   ```

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Ready to create a PR for your current feature branch
- Have committed changes that need review
- Want to link a PR to an issue tracker ticket
- Need to create a draft PR for early feedback
- **Updating an existing PR** (pass PR number or URL as argument)

### Update Existing PR Mode

When a PR number or URL is provided as argument, switch to "update" mode:
- Skip Steps 1-3 (branch check, ticket extraction) — use the existing PR's info
- Steps 4-5 still apply (source JTBD, generate body)
- Skip Step 6 (pre-PR checks) and Step 7 (push) — PR already exists
- Step 8 becomes "Update PR" using `gh pr edit`
- Steps 8-9 still apply (re-mark N/A checklist items, open browser, display summary)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Current State and Extract Ticket

Run the verification script:

```bash
$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-pr-create/scripts/verify-state.sh
```

This validates:
- Not on develop/main/master
- No uncommitted changes
- Has commits ahead of develop
- Branch does not include master-only commits (would cause PR to target master)

On success, outputs `BRANCH_NAME=<name>` and `ISSUE=<ticket-id>`.

**Verify base branch from live git data** — do not trust memory alone:
```bash
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
```
Use whatever branch this returns as the PR base.

### Step 2: Generate PR Title

**Single-commit PRs:** Use the commit title directly:

```bash
TITLE=$(git log -1 --format=%s)
```

**Multi-commit PRs:** The most recent commit title often describes the
last incremental step, not the overall change. Instead:

1. List all commit titles in the branch:
   ```bash
   git log origin/develop..HEAD --reverse --format=%s
   ```
2. Check if the JTBD "so I can" clause (from Step 3) suggests a
   better title — transform it to imperative form with the ticket's
   gitmoji prefix (e.g., "so I can reuse outbox for SMS" →
   `♻️ PROJ-551 Enable outbox reuse for SMS messaging`).
3. If no JTBD is available yet, select the commit title that best
   describes the **overall outcome** of the PR, not an intermediate
   step.
4. Present the candidate title to the user for approval.

**Guiding Principle:** The PR title should describe the user-facing
outcome, not the implementation detail.

### Step 3: Source or Generate Job Story

The PR body must start with a JTBD Job Story. Look for an existing one
before generating a new one.

**Step 3a: Detect issue tracker**

Run `detect-tracker.sh` with the ISSUE extracted from the branch name:

```bash
$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-context/scripts/detect-tracker.sh "$ISSUE"
```

Parse TRACKER and FIXES_URL from output.

**Step 3b: Search for existing Job Story**

Dispatch based on TRACKER:

| TRACKER | How to search |
|---------|--------------|
| `github` | `$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-context/scripts/gh-issue-get.sh` for body, `$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-context/scripts/gh-issue-comments.sh` for comments |
| `linear` | Linear MCP tools for description and comments |
| `jira` | JIRA API for description |
| `unknown` | Skip ticket search, rely on commit messages |

Search each source for the `**When**` / `**I want to**` / `**so I can**`
pattern.

**Step 3c: Check commit messages (fallback)**

If no Job Story found in the ticket:

```bash
git log origin/develop..HEAD --format=%B
```

**Step 3d: Generate a new one**

If none found, generate a Job Story:

- **For simple/trivial fixes** (flaky tests, typos, single-line changes):
  generate the Job Story inline in `**When** / **I want to** / **so I can**`
  format without invoking the full `dev10x:jtbd` skill.
- **For features, bug fixes, and multi-commit PRs**: follow the `dev10x:jtbd`
  base skill workflow:
  1. Gather context (ticket, parent ticket, diff)
  2. Identify the situation (who, trigger, current pain)
  3. Draft using format: `**When** [situation], **I want to** [motivation], **so I can** [expected outcome].`
  4. Present draft and ask user: "Apply this Job Story to the PR? (y/edit/n)"

### Step 4: Generate PR Body

The PR body must be **compact** to minimize notification preview size.
It starts with the Job Story, followed by a commit list with links and
the issue tracker reference.

**Generate commit list (for preview before PR creation):**
```bash
$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-pr-create/scripts/generate-commit-list.sh PLACEHOLDER
```

**Body format (Job Story + separator + commit list + issue link + separator + checklist):**
```markdown
**When** [situation], **I want to** [motivation], **so I can** [expected outcome].

---

[`b3a015a8`](REPO_URL/pull/NUMBER/commits/FULL_HASH) ✨ PROJ-36 Enable feature
[`fec49998`](REPO_URL/pull/NUMBER/commits/FULL_HASH) ♻️ PROJ-36 Refactor module

Fixes: {FIXES_URL from detect-tracker.sh}

---

{.github/checklist.md contents with TICKET-ID substituted}
```

If FIXES_URL is empty (unknown tracker), omit the `Fixes:` line entirely.

### Step 5: Run Pre-PR Checks

```bash
$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-pr-create/scripts/pre-pr-checks.sh
```

Automatically skips if no Python files changed. Runs ruff, formatting,
mypy, and pytest. Exits on first failure.

**If any check fails:**
- Stop the workflow
- Display the error output
- Suggest fix commands

### Step 6: Push and Create Draft PR

```bash
$HOME/.codex/skills/dev10x-gh-pr-create/scripts/create-pr.sh "$TITLE" "$JOB_STORY" "$ISSUE" "$FIXES_URL"
```

This script:
1. Pushes the branch with upstream tracking
2. Creates a draft PR targeting `develop` with plain commit list + checklist template
3. Gets the PR number
4. Updates the body with linked commits (using `generate-commit-list.sh`)
5. Outputs the PR number

### Step 7: Mark N/A Checklist Items in PR Body

Analyze `git diff origin/develop..HEAD` to determine which checklist items
don't apply to this PR, then update the PR body with strikethroughs:

**N/A detection heuristics:**
- No `migrations/` files in diff → strike migration items
- No new env var references → strike environment variable items
- No schema-breaking changes → strike breaking changes items

**Strike-through format:** Replace `- [ ] item text` with `- ~item text~`

**Update PR body:**
```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --body "$UPDATED_BODY"
```

### Step 8: Open PR in Browser

```bash
gh pr view --web
```

### Step 9: Display Summary

Show a success message with PR details:

```
✅ Pull Request Created

Title: 🐛 PROJ-123 Fix timeout handling
Branch: user/PROJ-123/fix-timeout
Status: Draft
Issue: {FIXES_URL}
PR URL: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456

Next steps:
- Review the PR in your browser
- Wait for CI checks to complete
- Mark as "Ready for review" when done
- Request reviewers if needed
```

## Important Notes

- Always create PRs as drafts initially
- **Always target `develop`** — the `--base develop` flag is mandatory
  in `create-pr.sh` and enforced by a PreToolUse hook
- Ensure branch is pushed before creating PR
- Handle existing PR case gracefully
- Link to issue tracker ticket in PR body (when FIXES_URL is available)
- **PR body starts with the Job Story** — sourced from ticket description,
  ticket comments, or generated fresh using the `dev10x:jtbd` base skill.
- **PR body contains the checklist** — Job Story + separator + commit
  list + issue tracker link + separator + checklist.
- Open PR in browser for immediate review

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is designed to be used standalone or as part of larger workflows:

- **ticket:work-on**: Could add an optional final step to create PR when work is done
- **dev10x:git-promote**: Uses this skill for Push and Create PR
- **test:fix-flaky**: Uses this skill for Create PR
- **Standalone usage**: User manually invokes when ready to create PR
