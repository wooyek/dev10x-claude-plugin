# Test Patterns Reviewer

Review test files for pattern compliance, coverage gaps, and
adherence to project testing conventions.

## Trigger

Files matching: `**/tests/**/*.py`

## Reminders

- Read project CLAUDE.md for local test conventions
- **Result fixture pattern**: fixture calling SUT is valid
- **`@pytest.mark.usefixtures`** for side-effect fixtures is correct
- **`pytest.skip()` base-class override** is valid for subclasses

## Checklist

1. **AAA pattern** — Arrange in fixtures, Act in result fixture,
   Assert in test methods
2. **`build()` over `create()`** — prefer in-memory Fakers when
   persistence not needed
2b. **Subprocess assertion consistency** — When tests call external
   commands via subprocess.run(), verify all similar tests assert
   returncode consistently. If test A asserts result.returncode == 0 but
   test B calls the same tool without asserting, the unasserted test may
   silently fail. Flag mixed assertion patterns as RECOMMENDED fix.
3. **Named parametrize** — project-specific parametrize helper
   preferred over `pytest.mark.parametrize` for named cases
4. **Set complement** — `set(Enum) - ALLOWED` is standard pattern
5. **Enum references** — use enum members not magic strings
6. **Schema coupling** — `Faker.build()` + `dataclasses.asdict()`
7. **Dead code** — Grep for imports of test helpers outside
   definition file
8. **Fixture DRY** — flag 3+ methods constructing same value;
   suggest result fixture extraction
8b. **Fixture-parametrization alignment** — When a test loads external
   fixture data (baseline JSON, config files, etc.) and uses parametrize()
   to test entries, verify the parametrize list covers all fixture entries.
   If baseline has 4 entries but parametrize only covers 3, regression
   detection is incomplete. Flag as RECOMMENDED: either remove the unused
   fixture entry or add it to parametrize coverage.
9. **Mock-to-integration upgrade** — when mock-based tests are
   replaced by DB-backed, note as improvement
10. **Mockito teardown** — `unstub()` must be in fixture teardown
    (`yield` + `unstub()`), not inline after `verify()`
11. **Module-level global teardown** — fixtures resetting globals
    must use `yield` + teardown for cleanup safety. CRITICAL.
12. **Cross-file fixture DRY** — same helper in multiple test files
    in same package → suggest extraction to `conftest.py`. WARNING.
13. **Factory inheritance patterns** — verify factories use inheritance
    for specialized variants; base class should have sensible defaults
    for all required fields; subclasses should override only what differs.
14. **New class without test suite** — when a PR adds a new
    production class (excluding tests/, migrations/, pure DTOs,
    and abstract base classes), flag if no corresponding
    `test_{module}.py` exists or is modified in the same PR.
    WARNING. Indirect coverage via caller tests is fragile —
    when the caller changes, extracted class coverage silently
    disappears.
15. **Playbook mode coverage** — when a skill uses `playbook.yaml`
    with multiple plays (e.g., `single`, `batch`), verify tests
    cover: (a) mode detection logic, (b) correct play selection,
    (c) condition field evaluation. Test at least one mode transition
    (e.g., single → batch). Flag missing mode coverage as WARNING.
