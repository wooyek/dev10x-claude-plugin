# PR Merge Policy: REQUIRED vs RECOMMENDED Feedback

How code review feedback is classified and whether it blocks merge.

## Feedback Classification

### REQUIRED Feedback

Marked with **REQUIRED:**, these items must be addressed before merge can proceed.

- **When enforced**: Merge is blocked until REQUIRED items are addressed
- **How to address**:
  - Create commits that fix the issue
  - Reply to comment with commit SHA
  - Author pushes changes; feedback is re-verified
- **If unaddressed**: PR cannot merge; reviewer or author must resolve before approval

**Example REQUIRED items**:
- PR body format violations (missing JTBD, missing `Fixes:` link, disallowed separators)
- Commit message format errors (missing gitmoji, ticket ID)
- Code conflicts with codebase conventions
- False positives verified by author response

### RECOMMENDED Feedback

Marked with **RECOMMENDED** or presented without explicit enforcement marker, these items are suggestions.

- **When applied**: Author may acknowledge, defer, or address per judgment
- **How to handle**:
  - Author may fix (create fixup commit)
  - Author may reply explaining deferral
  - Merge proceeds with or without addressing
- **If unaddressed**: Merge is allowed; no blocking

**Example RECOMMENDED items**:
- Suggestion to refactor for clarity (not correctness)
- Optional enhancement ideas
- Nice-to-haves flagged for future work
- Informational context

## Review Workflow

1. **Initial review** — Claude or maintainer posts feedback
2. **Author responds** — Creates fixup commits or replies to comments
3. **Force-push** — Feedback is re-verified after author pushes changes
4. **Re-review check** — On force-push, all feedback is re-evaluated
5. **Merge gate** — REQUIRED items must be addressed; RECOMMENDED may remain

## Frictionless Merge Feature

The `gh pr merge` feature (available after PR #455) enables one-command merge without web UI.

- **Impact**: Reduces friction but makes format compliance critical
- **Enforcement**: CI checks validate PR body format before merge is allowed
- **Responsibility**: Author must ensure REQUIRED feedback is addressed

## When Feedback is Re-Checked

Feedback is re-evaluated in these scenarios:

- **Force-push**: When author pushes new commits (common after fixup squash)
- **Author comment**: When author replies to explain changes
- **Manual request**: When reviewer requests another review pass

Feedback is **not** automatically re-checked after simple file edits or
approvals — it requires a commit push to re-trigger.

## Merge Configuration (Fanout / Work-On)

When `Dev10x:fanout` or `Dev10x:work-on` orchestrate PR merges,
two playbook-level fields control behavior.

### `merge_mode`

Controls whether PRs are merged autonomously after CI passes.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `manual` | Mark ready, stop. User merges explicitly. |
| `autonomous` | After CI green + no comments → auto-merge |
| `cascade` | Autonomous + auto-rebase downstream PRs |

**Resolution order** (first match wins):
1. Session friction level — `adaptive` defaults to `cascade`
2. Playbook override — `merge_mode` in `work-on.yaml`
3. Default — `manual`

### `merge_strategy`

Controls the `gh pr merge` flag passed during merge.

| Strategy | Flag | When to use |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Rebase | `--rebase` | Default — atomic commits preserved |
| Squash | `--squash` | Single-commit PRs or messy history |
| Merge commit | `--merge` | Protected branches requiring merge |

**Resolution order** (first match wins):
1. Playbook override — `merge_strategy` in `work-on.yaml`
2. Memory note — user feedback memory mentioning preference
3. Default — `--rebase`

### Playbook Configuration

Add these fields to your playbook override (see
`references/config-resolution.md` for paths):

```yaml
merge_mode: cascade
merge_strategy: squash
```
