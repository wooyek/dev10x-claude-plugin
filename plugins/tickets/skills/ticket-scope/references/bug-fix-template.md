# [Bug Fix Title]

## Bug Description

**Reported by:** [Customer Support / Sentry / Internal QA / Production User]
**Frequency:** [How often - "Intermittent" / "Always" / "Under X conditions"]
**Impact:** [User impact - "Checkout fails" / "Data incorrect" / "UI broken"]
**Severity:** [High / Medium / Low]

[Detailed description of the incorrect behavior]

Example:
"When a customer applies a tax-exempt purchase to a work order, the Square payment amount includes sales tax incorrectly. This causes the customer to be overcharged, and the work order total doesn't match the payment amount."

**How to reproduce:**
1. Create work order for tax-exempt customer
2. Add taxable items (tires)
3. Process Square terminal checkout
4. Observe: Square amount includes tax, work order doesn't

**Expected behavior:**
Square payment amount should exclude sales tax for tax-exempt customers, matching the work order total.

**Actual behavior:**
Square payment includes sales tax even for tax-exempt customers.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why this happens:**

[Technical explanation of the bug's cause]

Example:
1. Work order correctly applies tax exemption during quote calculation
2. Tax exemption is stored in `Customer.tax_exemption` field
3. `OrderConverter.__call__()` generates Square order dynamically
4. Bug: `OrderConverter` reads tax settings via `TaxSettingsRepository.get_by_store_id()` but doesn't read customer tax exemption
5. Result: Square order always includes taxes, ignoring customer-level exemption

**Code location:**
- `src/payments/square/orders.py:OrderConverter.__call__()` (line 45-70)
  - Missing: Customer tax exemption lookup
  - Uses: `TaxSettingsRepository.get_by_store_id()` only

- `src/tiretutor_pos/quotes/repository.py:WorkOrderRepository.tax_exemption()` (line 156)
  - Correct: Reads customer exemption properly
  - Not used: By OrderConverter

**When bug was introduced:**
- Likely present since tax exemption feature added
- Not caught because tax-exempt customer tests missing in Square integration tests

---

## Solution

**Fix approach:**

[Technical solution description]

Example:
1. Update `OrderConverter.__call__()` to accept `tax_exemption: TaxExemption` parameter
2. Update `WorkOrderCheckoutCreator.create_checkout()` to pass tax exemption:
   - Read from `WorkOrderRepository.tax_exemption(work_order_id)`
   - Pass to `OrderConverter`
3. Update `OrderConverter._get_taxes()` to respect tax exemption:
   - If `TaxExemption.APPLY_NO_TAXES`, return empty taxes
   - If `TaxExemption.APPLY_NO_SALES_TAX`, exclude sales tax
   - If `TaxExemption.APPLY_ALL_TAXES`, use current behavior

**Why this fixes it:**

[Explanation of why solution works]

Example:
- OrderConverter will now receive customer tax exemption status
- Square order will be generated with correct tax amounts
- Matches work order tax calculation logic
- No breaking changes to other payment flows

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update OrderConverter to Accept Tax Exemption**
   - File: `src/payments/square/orders.py`
   - Method: `OrderConverter.__call__(work_order, tax_exemption: TaxExemption)`
   - Add parameter with default `TaxExemption.APPLY_ALL_TAXES` (backwards compatible)
   - Reference: `src/tiretutor_pos/quotes/pricing/taxes/dto.py:TaxExemption`

2. **Update OrderConverter._get_taxes() to Respect Exemption**
   - File: `src/payments/square/orders.py`
   - Method: `OrderConverter._get_taxes()`
   - Logic:
     ```python
     if self.tax_exemption == TaxExemption.APPLY_NO_TAXES:
         return {}
     if self.tax_exemption == TaxExemption.APPLY_NO_SALES_TAX:
         return {k: v for k, v in taxes.items() if k != 'SALES'}
     return taxes
     ```
   - Reference: `src/tiretutor_pos/quotes/pricing/calculator.py` for exemption logic

3. **Update WorkOrderCheckoutCreator to Pass Tax Exemption**
   - File: `src/payments/square/terminal.py`
   - Method: `WorkOrderCheckoutCreator.create_checkout()`
   - Add:
     ```python
     tax_exemption = self.work_order_repo.tax_exemption(work_order_id)
     order = self.order_converter(work_order, tax_exemption)
     ```
   - Reference: Existing `work_order_repo` usage

4. **Write Test for Bug Scenario**
   - File: `src/payments/square/tests/test_orders.py`
   - Test class: `TestOrderConverterWithTaxExemption`
   - Tests:
     - `test_no_taxes_for_fully_exempt_customer()`
     - `test_no_sales_tax_for_sales_exempt_customer()`
     - `test_all_taxes_for_non_exempt_customer()`
   - Pattern: Parametrize with different `TaxExemption` values
   - Faker: `WorkOrderFaker.create(customer__tax_exemption=TaxExemption.APPLY_NO_SALES_TAX)`
   - Reference: `src/tiretutor_pos/quotes/tests/test_pricing.py` for tax exemption tests

5. **Write Integration Test**
   - File: `src/payments/square/terminal/tests/test_terminal.py`
   - Test: `test_checkout_respects_customer_tax_exemption()`
   - Verify: Square order amount excludes tax for exempt customer
   - Reference: Existing terminal checkout tests

6. **Run Tests**
   - Command: `pytest src/payments/square/tests/ src/payments/square/terminal/tests/`
   - Verify: All tests pass, new bug scenario covered

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tax-exempt customers are NOT charged sales tax in Square orders
- [ ] Partially exempt customers only charged applicable taxes
- [ ] Non-exempt customers still charged all taxes (no regression)
- [ ] Square order amount matches work order total
- [ ] Existing payment flows unaffected
- [ ] Tests added for all exemption scenarios
- [ ] Bug no longer reproducible in staging
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at 100%

---

## Rollout

**Testing:**
1. Deploy to staging
2. Test with tax-exempt customer accounts:
   - Fully exempt (no taxes)
   - Sales exempt (labor tax only)
   - Non-exempt (all taxes)
3. Verify Square order amounts match work order totals

**Deployment:**
- Deploy in regular release cycle
- No migration needed
- Monitor Sentry for related errors

**Monitoring:**
- Watch for `SquareOrderAmountMismatchError` (if exists)
- Monitor customer support tickets about overcharges
- Check Square payment success rates

**Rollback:**
- Simple code revert if issues
- No data to rollback
- Low risk change

## Resolution for Release Notes

**Fixed: Tax-exempt customers charged incorrect amounts**

We've fixed a bug where tax-exempt customers were incorrectly charged sales tax when paying through Square terminal checkout. The payment amount now correctly reflects the customer's tax exemption status, matching the work order total.

**Impact:** Tax-exempt customers will no longer be overcharged during checkout.
