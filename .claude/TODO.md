- [ ] Task 5: Add dev10x:gh skill with 4 scripts — sanitize tiretutorinc/tt-pos and janusz/PAY-616 refs in SKILL.md + gh-pr-detect.sh comments. See docs/plans/2026-02-27-skill-migration-batch1.md §Task 5
- [ ] Task 6: Add dev10x:skill-motd skill — copy SKILL.md + generate-motd.sh, write sanitized dependencies.txt (strip project-specific skill entries). See docs/plans/2026-02-27-skill-migration-batch1.md §Task 6
- [ ] Task 7: Commit docs/plans/ directory (design doc + implementation plan created during brainstorming)
- [ ] Untracked: docs/ and skills/dev10x:skill-audit/ are unstaged — Task 4 was mid-flight when session ended
